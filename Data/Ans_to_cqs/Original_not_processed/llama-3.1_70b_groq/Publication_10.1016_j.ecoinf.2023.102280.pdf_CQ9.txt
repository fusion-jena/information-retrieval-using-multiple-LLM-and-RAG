Answer:::
The text mentions "zenodo.3243139" which suggests that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo. However, it does not provide a direct link or a clear statement about the availability of the pipeline on other repositories such as Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer is that the data repository is available on Zenodo, but it is unclear if it is also available on other platforms.
