Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, and it discusses various studies and research papers related to this topic. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
