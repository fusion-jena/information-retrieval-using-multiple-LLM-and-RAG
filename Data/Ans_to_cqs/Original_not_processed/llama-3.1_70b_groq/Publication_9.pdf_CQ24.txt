Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly in image segmentation and classification tasks. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, transfer learning, and the challenges of working with limited and imbalanced datasets. However, it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline.
