Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used in the no-overfitting and overfitting settings, such as the learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and number of training epochs. However, it does not provide information on the optimization method used to select these hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
