Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a combination of random search and exploration of various parameter values. According to the text, "Various combinations of Pmean and Pstd values, along with typical hyperparameters of neural networks such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay, were tested and explored." Additionally, it is mentioned that "These values were assigned using random generators to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance." This suggests that the hyperparameters are optimized using a random search approach, where different combinations of hyperparameters are randomly selected and evaluated. However, it is not explicitly stated whether a grid search or other optimization methods are used in addition to random search.
