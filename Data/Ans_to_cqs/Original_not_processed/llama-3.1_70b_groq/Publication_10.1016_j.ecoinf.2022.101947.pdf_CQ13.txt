Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The text appears to be discussing the results of a study on Amur tigers and leopards, and the use of a classification model to predict the identity of tigers. However, the specific details of the deep learning model, including the hyperparameters, are not mentioned.
