The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to ecological risk assessment, carbon sink risk zones, and socio-economic factors, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
