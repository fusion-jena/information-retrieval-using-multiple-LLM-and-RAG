Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It only mentions that deep learning methods, specifically CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), will be most effective and useful to map land cover or woody cover in future studies. However, it does not provide information on the frameworks used to build these models.
