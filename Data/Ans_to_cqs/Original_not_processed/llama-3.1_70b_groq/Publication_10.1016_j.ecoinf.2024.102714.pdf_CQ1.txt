Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of EO-data (Earth Observation data) and contextual datasets in the context of habitat mapping. It also mentions the use of knowledge-based rules and contextual information to translate Vegetation Types to habitat classes.

It can be inferred that the data collection methods might include remote sensing and Earth observation data, as well as possibly surveys and other contextual datasets. However, the exact methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of EO-datasets in Wales (Lucas et al., 2011), which suggests that remote sensing data might be one of the data sources used. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
