Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of crowdsourced dense image annotations in the Visual Genome dataset [54]. This suggests that the dataset may have been annotated using techniques such as object detection, segmentation, and possibly even instance segmentation. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of feature visualisation techniques, such as reconstructing feature maps/channels back to image pixels to reveal the structures within each patch that stimulated a particular feature map. This is done using the DN approach [36], but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a dataset called PlantClef2015 [6], which is a plant recognition dataset. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used in this dataset.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest that crowdsourced dense image annotations and feature visualisation techniques may have been used.
