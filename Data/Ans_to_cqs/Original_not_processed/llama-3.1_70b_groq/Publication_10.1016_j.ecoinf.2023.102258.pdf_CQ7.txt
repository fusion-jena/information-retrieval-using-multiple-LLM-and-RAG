Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily discusses the challenges of working with audio data in bioacoustics, the limitations of deep learning models, and the use of transductive few-shot learning and meta-learning methods to adapt to scarce data. It also mentions the use of post-processing techniques to join detections that span chunks of audio data.

However, it does mention that deep learning models typically divide long audio files into shorter chunks (with fixed durations of e.g., 3 or 10 seconds) to fit within the limited memory of GPUs. But this is not directly related to the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
