Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the entire training set was presented in a random order in each epoch, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse set of data, but it does not provide information on cross-validation or stratified splitting.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was compared to other algorithms using the same test set, which implies that the model was evaluated on a separate test set that was not used for training. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into training and test sets, or whether any techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
