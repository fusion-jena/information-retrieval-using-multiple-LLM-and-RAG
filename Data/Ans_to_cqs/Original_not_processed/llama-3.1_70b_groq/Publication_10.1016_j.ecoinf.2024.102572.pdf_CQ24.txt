Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on forestry, forest fires, and ecological informatics, with references to research papers on topics such as forest fragmentation, forest fire prediction models, and the effects of forest fires on soil properties.

There is no mention of deep learning, machine learning, or any related concepts that would suggest a connection to handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a meaningful answer to this question.
