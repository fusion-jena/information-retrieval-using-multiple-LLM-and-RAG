Answer: 
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the well-known datasets like MNIST or CIFAR. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained on 7362 labelled images. Additionally, the model utilised transfer learning by initialising an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. This suggests that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset before being fine-tuned on the 7362 labelled images.
