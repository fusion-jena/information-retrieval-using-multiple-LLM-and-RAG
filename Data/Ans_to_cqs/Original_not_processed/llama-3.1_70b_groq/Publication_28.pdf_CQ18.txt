Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the overall system architecture, the design of the IKHO algorithm for parameter optimization, and the experimental results analysis of the PTDLEN-VAE model. However, it does mention that the PTDLEN-VAE model is validated on a benchmark dataset and the experimental results are discussed in terms of different aspects, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using these metrics, but the specific strategy for monitoring performance during training is not mentioned.
