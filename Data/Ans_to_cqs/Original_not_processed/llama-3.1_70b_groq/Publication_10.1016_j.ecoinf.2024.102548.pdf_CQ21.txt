Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on model parameters, training time, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy. It also touches upon the fine-tuning process and the calculation of the loss function. However, it does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Although, it does mention the calculation of accuracy using the formula A = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), which is related to the confusion matrix. But it does not provide a detailed explanation of the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
