Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of regularization coefficients and kernel parameters in some of the model configurations.

For example, in one of the configurations, the regularization coefficient is set to 3E+05, and the kernel parameter is set to 7000. In another configuration, the regularization coefficient is set to 9E+06, and the kernel parameter is set to 9E+05. Additionally, some configurations mention the use of a "regular_para" parameter, which is set to values such as 0.2, 0.05, or 2.

While these parameters may be related to regularization, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
