Answer:::

After model training, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context include:

1. Metrics calculation: The performance of the models is evaluated using three standard metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (r2).
2. SHAP values calculation: SHAP values are computed using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the greening season.

There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix in the provided context. Saliency maps are typically used for image classification tasks to visualize which parts of the image contribute most to the model's prediction. Since the context does not mention image classification, it is unlikely that saliency maps are used. Confusion matrix is also not mentioned, which is typically used for classification tasks to evaluate the model's performance. The context only mentions regression tasks, so confusion matrix is not applicable.
