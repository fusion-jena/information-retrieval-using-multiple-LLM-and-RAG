Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It discusses the model architecture, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the use of transfer learning with Inception v3, but it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this case.
