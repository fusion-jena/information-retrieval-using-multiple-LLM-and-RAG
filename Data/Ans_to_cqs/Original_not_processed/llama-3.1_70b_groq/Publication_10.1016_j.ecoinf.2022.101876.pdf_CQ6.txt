Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model like MegaDetector. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of the MegaDetector model, its architecture (Faster R-CNN), and its application in wildlife camera trap image processing.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on hundreds of thousands of images labeled by manual human review from a wide variety of ecosystems. This suggests that some form of data preprocessing, such as data cleaning and labeling, was involved in preparing the training data. Nevertheless, specific details on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or other techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the given context.
