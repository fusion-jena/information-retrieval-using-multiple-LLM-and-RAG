Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on a cellular automaton model for predicting real-world phenomena such as wildfire spreads or pest plant propagation, and discusses potential improvements to the model, limitations, and considerations for parameter values. However, it does not provide information on data collection methods.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
