Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context primarily focuses on the model architecture, loss function, and experimental results, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria for training.

However, it is common in deep learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or a maximum number of epochs to determine when training is complete. But without explicit information, it is impossible to determine the specific criteria used in this study.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete in this study.
