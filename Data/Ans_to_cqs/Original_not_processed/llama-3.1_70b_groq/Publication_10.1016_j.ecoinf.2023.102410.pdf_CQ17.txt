Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to data analysis, specifically the tracking of vocalisations and their song structures, as well as the importance of accurate sound speed profiles for localising sound sources. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.
