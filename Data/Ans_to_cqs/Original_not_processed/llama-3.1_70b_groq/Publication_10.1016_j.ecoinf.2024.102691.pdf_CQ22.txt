Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at various Intersections Over Union (IoU) thresholds. Specifically, the evaluation metrics used are:

* Precision (P) = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive)
* Recall (R) = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)
* Average Precision (AP) = âˆ«[0,1] Precision(Recall)d(Recall)

Additionally, the AP0.5, which indicates average precision at 50% IoU, is used to provide a more balanced reflection of the global detection performance of the model. The F1 Score is also reported, although the formula for calculating it is not provided in the given context.
