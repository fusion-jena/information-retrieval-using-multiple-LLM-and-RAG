Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction and species distribution modeling, as well as the use of bioclimatic variables and remote sensing imagery.

However, it does mention that bioclimatic variables were extracted from raster layers at a global level, which were downloaded from WorldClim v2.1 at a resolution of 2.5 minutes. This suggests that the data may have been obtained from publicly available datasets or remote sensing sources.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks for modeling species distribution, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected for training these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
