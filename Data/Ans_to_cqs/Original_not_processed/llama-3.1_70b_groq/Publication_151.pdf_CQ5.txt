Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it mentions that the evaluation was performed on simulated data sets, specifically a 200-taxon data set and a 10,000-taxon data set. These datasets appear to be related to phylogenetic tree construction and query sequence placement, rather than image classification tasks typically associated with MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
