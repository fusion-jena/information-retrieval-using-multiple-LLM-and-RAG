Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The text appears to be a research paper discussing the analysis of observational complex networks in the context of urban acoustic environments. It mentions the use of Python 3.8.5 and various packages for analysis, as well as the provision of code and a demo dataset on GitHub. However, it does not discuss the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
