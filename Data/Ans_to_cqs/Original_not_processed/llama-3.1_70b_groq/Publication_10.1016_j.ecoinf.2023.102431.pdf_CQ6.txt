Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text appears to be discussing the development of a non-invasive survey method called FIT (Footprint Identification Technique) for species and sex identification, but it does not delve into the details of deep learning model training.

However, it does mention that "outliers and removed from the dataset for subsequent analyses." This suggests that some form of data cleaning is involved, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
