Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that a 3:1 train-test split was employed for model training in the context of an ensemble framework using five statistical models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS). This suggests that the data was split into training and testing sets in a 3:1 ratio, but it does not provide information on the criteria used for this split or whether a validation set was used.
