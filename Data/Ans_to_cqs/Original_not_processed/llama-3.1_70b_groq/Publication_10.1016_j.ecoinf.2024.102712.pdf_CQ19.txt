Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It mentions modelling frameworks in general, but does not specify any particular ones. It also mentions specific studies and authors (e.g., St√•hl et al., 2016, Saarela et al., 2016, 2018) but does not provide information on the frameworks used to build deep learning models.
