Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its evaluation metrics. The text appears to be discussing Bayesian Networks (BNs) and their application to permafrost modeling, specifically the PermaBN model. It mentions potential avenues for future work, such as reducing uncertainty in Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) and exploring algorithms for determining CPTs, but it does not mention deep learning or evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall.
