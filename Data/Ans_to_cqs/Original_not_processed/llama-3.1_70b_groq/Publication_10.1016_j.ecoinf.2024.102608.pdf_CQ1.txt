Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral imagery (Hong et al., 2022) and remote sensing data (Irons et al., 2012) in the context of water quality monitoring and reservoir management. This suggests that remote sensing data and hyperspectral imagery may be used as sources of raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of datasets, such as those from the Landsat satellite (Irons et al., 2012), which implies that publicly available datasets may also be used as a source of raw data.

However, it is unclear whether surveys or other methods are used for collecting raw data, as this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
