Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model error reached its minimum when the number of input variables (M) was 7, as shown in Fig. 1a. Additionally, it states that the model error tended to be stable after the number of trees (Nt) reached 200, as shown in Fig. 1b.

It can be inferred that the training process may have been stopped when the model error stabilized or reached a minimum, but the exact criteria used to determine the completion of training are not specified. The context does mention that the model was evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and R2, but it does not provide information on how these metrics were used to determine the completion of training.
