Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm" in the Report 1998, but it does not provide further details on the frameworks used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
