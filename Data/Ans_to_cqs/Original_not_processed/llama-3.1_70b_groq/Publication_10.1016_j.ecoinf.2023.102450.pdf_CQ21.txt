Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the training of a Siamese network using few-shot learning, the evaluation of animal tracking, and the impact of interference.

However, it does mention the refinement module, which effectively integrates the relation detector into the Siamese framework to suppress false-positive detections and filter background interference. Additionally, it mentions the calculation of prediction error and mean prediction error, but it does not provide further details on other postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
