Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite imagery as a source of data. Specifically, it mentions that "satellite imagery accumulates owing to continuous satellite observations" and that this imagery is used to generate Permanent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data, which is then used to train a deep learning model.

It can be inferred that satellite remote sensing is one of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide information on other potential methods, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that satellite remote sensing is one of the methods used for collecting raw data, but the context does not provide a comprehensive list of all methods used.
