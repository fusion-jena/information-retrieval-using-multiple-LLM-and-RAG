Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix. The context appears to be focused on event-stream processing, machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence in the context of biology and neuroscience.

However, I can provide some general information on the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query. Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features in a machine learning model. Metrics calculation typically involves evaluating the performance of a model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A Confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

But, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in the context of the provided references.
