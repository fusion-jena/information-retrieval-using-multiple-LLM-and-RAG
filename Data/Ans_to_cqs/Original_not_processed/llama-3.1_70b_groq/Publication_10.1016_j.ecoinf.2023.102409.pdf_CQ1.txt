Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the mean groundwater data was derived from a Machine Learning model constructed based on groundwater monitoring data collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin. This suggests that sensor data from monitoring wells was used as a source of raw data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of remote sensing images with a high resolution of 0.8 m, which implies that satellite or aerial imagery was used as another source of raw data. The context also mentions the use of ArcGIS for resampling climate and DEM data, which suggests that public datasets or existing geospatial data sources were utilized.

However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or other methods were used for collecting raw data. Therefore, the answer to the query is incomplete, and it can be concluded that sensor data from monitoring wells and remote sensing images were used, but the use of surveys or other methods is unknown.
