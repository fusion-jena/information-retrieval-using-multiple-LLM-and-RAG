Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context appears to be related to data mining, association rule mining, and crop yield forecasting, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
