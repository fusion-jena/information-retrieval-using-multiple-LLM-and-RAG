Answer: None of the provided context mentions the use of a deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. The context only mentions traditional machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), Ensemble learning method (Random Forest), and Linear regression method. It does not provide any information about the use of deep learning models.
