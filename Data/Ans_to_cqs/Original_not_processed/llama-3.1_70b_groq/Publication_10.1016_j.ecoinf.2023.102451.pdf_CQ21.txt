Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the performance evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

According to section 3.4, the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net is evaluated on unseen test sets of the datasets by calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-Score. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated using these metrics, but it does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can only confirm that the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-Score metrics, but I do not know if other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices are involved.
