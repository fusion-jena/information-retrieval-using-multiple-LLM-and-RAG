Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses the proposed model, preprocessing steps, and performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models. It also mentions the use of class weights to handle imbalanced datasets and the implementation of the model using the sklearn library in Python. However, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
