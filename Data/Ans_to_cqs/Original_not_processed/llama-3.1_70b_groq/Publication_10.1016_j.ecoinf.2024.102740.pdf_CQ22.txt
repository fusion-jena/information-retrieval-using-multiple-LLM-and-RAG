Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF) technique for classification and regression tasks, and mentions the use of "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples for estimating the generalization error. However, it does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

The context does mention that the most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2, but it does not provide further details on how accuracy was measured or what other metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
