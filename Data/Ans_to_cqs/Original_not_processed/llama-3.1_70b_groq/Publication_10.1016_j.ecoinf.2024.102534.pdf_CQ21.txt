Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention the use of certain metrics to assess the performance of model predictions. 

Specifically, it mentions the use of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) to evaluate the performance of model predictions. Additionally, it mentions the classification of predictive maps into unsuitable (0–0.6) and suitable (0.6–1) areas, with a threshold value of 0.6 derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity.

It also mentions the comparison of predictive maps of four groups of orchids during three time periods to identify the potential impact of climate change and land cover change on suitable areas for each group. However, it does not provide information on the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not provide a comprehensive list of postprocessing steps involved after model training, but it does mention the use of certain metrics and classification techniques to evaluate and interpret the model predictions.
