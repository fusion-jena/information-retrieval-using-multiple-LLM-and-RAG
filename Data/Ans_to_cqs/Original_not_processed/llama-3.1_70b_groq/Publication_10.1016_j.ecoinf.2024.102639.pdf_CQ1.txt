Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the analysis and classification of animal behavior, specifically zebrafish and rat movements in T-maze environments, using various machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM, and PCA-SVM.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data is likely collected through observational studies or experiments, possibly using sensors or cameras to track the movements of the animals. But without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data.

Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, and I would need more information to provide a more accurate answer.
