Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deep learning model training, splitting data for training, testing, and validation, or criteria used for such purposes. The context appears to be related to optimizing parameters for a Land Trends (LTR) algorithm, specifically for modeling disturbance-recovery patterns in the context of wildfires, climate, and vegetation cover conditions. It discusses parameters such as MS (maximum number of segments) and RT (threshold of the fast recovery event) but does not touch upon deep learning model training or data splitting criteria.
