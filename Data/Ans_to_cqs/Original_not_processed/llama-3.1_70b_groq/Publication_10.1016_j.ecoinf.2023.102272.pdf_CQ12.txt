Answer: The pipeline uses various deep learning architectures, including Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the best-performing models, such as model 12 and model 19, have a DeepConvLSTM architecture, while model 14 has a CNN architecture.
