Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model, but rather discusses the evaluation of a classifier's performance using certain metrics. According to the context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classifier are:

1. Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model is mentioned, with a value of 0.967 for thinned samples and 0.968 for all samples.
2. True Positive Rate (Sensitivity): This metric measures the number of predicted observations that were accurately assigned to a class.
3. True Negative Rate (Specificity): This metric measures the number of predicted observations where the response variable of interest did not occur.

There is no mention of precision or recall in the provided context.
