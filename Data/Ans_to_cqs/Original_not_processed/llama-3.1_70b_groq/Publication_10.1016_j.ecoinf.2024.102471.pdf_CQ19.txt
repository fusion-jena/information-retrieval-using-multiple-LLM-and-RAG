Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the models discussed (Wav2vec, Hybrid CNN-LSTM, Vision Transformer). The context primarily focuses on the architectures and their applications, without delving into the implementation details or specific frameworks used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
