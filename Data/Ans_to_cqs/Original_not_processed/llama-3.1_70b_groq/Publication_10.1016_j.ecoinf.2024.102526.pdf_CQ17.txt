Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to image and data curation, metadata, and documentation, with some references to ecological and oceanographic research. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.
