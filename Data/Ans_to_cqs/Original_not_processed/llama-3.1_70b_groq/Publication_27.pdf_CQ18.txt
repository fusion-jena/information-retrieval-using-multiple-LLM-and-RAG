Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be a collection of mathematical and scientific notations, equations, and diagrams, but it does not provide a clear explanation of the strategy used to monitor model performance.

However, based on the context, it seems that the document is related to a research paper or academic article, possibly in the field of machine learning or artificial intelligence. The notations and equations suggest that the paper may be discussing a specific algorithm or model, but without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact strategy used to monitor model performance.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
