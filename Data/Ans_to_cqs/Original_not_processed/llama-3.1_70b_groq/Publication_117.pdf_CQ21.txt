Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the bounding boxes were manually checked and corrected for each of the 20,000 training images after the initial filter.

Additionally, the context mentions that the deviation of each method from the single expert count was assessed, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation was performed. However, the specific metrics used are not mentioned.

It is also mentioned that the data included the number of wildebeest counted by each user, their username, and the pixel location of each of their identifications, which could be used to calculate metrics such as accuracy or precision. However, the context does not provide further information on the specific postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
