I don't know. The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to ecology and conservation biology, discussing topics such as habitat suitability, species distribution, and the impacts of human activities on wildlife. It does not provide information on deep learning or machine learning techniques.
