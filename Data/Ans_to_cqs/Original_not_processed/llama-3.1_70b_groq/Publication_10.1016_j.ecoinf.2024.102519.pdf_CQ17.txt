Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses various applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization algorithms in fields such as drought modeling, soil cation exchange capacity prediction, and mineral prospecting. It also mentions the use of genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and deep learning, but does not delve into the specifics of regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.

However, it does mention the use of techniques such as combining artificial neural networks with firefly algorithms, enhanced machine learning methods, and the use of genetic algorithms to optimize SVM and K-means algorithms. But it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
