Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the use of pseudo-labeling (PL) methods, teacher-student structures, and species distribution modeling (SDM) using deep neural networks. It mentions that ecological studies typically use preprocessed environmental data at meter- or kilometer-level resolution, but it does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps involved.

However, it can be inferred that the data used for training the models is likely to be environmental data, which may involve preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. But without explicit information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
