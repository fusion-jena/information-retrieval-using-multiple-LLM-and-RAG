Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the architecture and training of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, but it does not provide information on data preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know what preprocessing steps are involved in this specific case.
