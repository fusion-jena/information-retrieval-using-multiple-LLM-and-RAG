Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on data mining, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), and the Apriori algorithm, which are related to identifying patterns and relationships in datasets. It does not discuss deep learning pipelines or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, I can provide some general information on the techniques mentioned in the query. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are indeed techniques used to address data bias in machine learning pipelines, including deep learning. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data into subsets based on the target variable to maintain the same proportion of classes in each subset. Oversampling involves creating additional copies of the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from diverse sources to reduce bias.

But, I don't know if these techniques are specifically used in the context of the provided text, as it does not discuss deep learning pipelines or data bias.
