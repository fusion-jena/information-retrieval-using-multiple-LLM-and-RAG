The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or the use of any specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It only mentions the potential extension of the use of ecoacoustic indices (EAI) to fields like machine learning and deep learning, but it does not provide any information about the actual deployment of a deep learning model.
