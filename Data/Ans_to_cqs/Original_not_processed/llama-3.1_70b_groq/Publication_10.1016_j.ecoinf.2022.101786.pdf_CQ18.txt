Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to evaluate its performance on the validation set after each cycle of training on the training set, adjusting the CNN node weights, and repeating the entire cycle. This process is repeated for a number of iterations, and the performance on the validation and training sets is monitored to determine the optimum number of iterations before the model starts to overfit and becomes less able to generalize to new data.
