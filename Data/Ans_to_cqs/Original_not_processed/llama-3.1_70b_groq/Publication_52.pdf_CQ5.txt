Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are:

1. ImageNet LSVRC-2010: This dataset was used to train a large deep convolutional neural network to classify 1.2 million high-resolution images into 1000 different classes.

Additionally, the context mentions that experiments were conducted on three popular datasets for object recognition, specifically for face, pedestrian, and car recognition. However, the names of these specific datasets are not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of other datasets in various studies, such as the ones related to bird acoustic event detection, marine species identification, and sound event classification. However, the names of these datasets are not explicitly mentioned.

There is no mention of the MNIST or CIFAR datasets in the provided context.
