Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention "Microsoft COCO: common objects in context" in one of the references (Lin, T.-Y., et al., May 2014), which suggests that the COCO dataset might be used in the pipeline. Additionally, the context mentions YOLOv5s, which is a real-time object detection system, and it is commonly used with datasets like COCO.

However, without more explicit information, it is difficult to confirm the exact datasets used in the pipeline. Other popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is that the COCO dataset might be used, but it is not explicitly confirmed, and other datasets are not mentioned.
