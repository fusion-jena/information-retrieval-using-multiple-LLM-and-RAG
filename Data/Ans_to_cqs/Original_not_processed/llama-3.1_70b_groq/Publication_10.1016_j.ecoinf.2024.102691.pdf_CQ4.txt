Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the attention mechanism, network architecture, and training process of the depth-attention YOLOv5 model. It discusses the use of various attention mechanisms, such as SE, CBAM, ECA, CA, Non-Local, and GCNet, but does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

However, it does mention that the input image size was set to 512 Ã— 512 and the maximum batch size was limited to 4 during model training. It also mentions the use of a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. But it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
