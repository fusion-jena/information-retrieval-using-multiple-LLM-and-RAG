Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is trained on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species, and that data augmentation is used in combination with the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

It can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been applied to the audio data, such as converting the audio files into a suitable format for the CNN model, but the specific steps are not mentioned.

The context does mention the use of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as a baseline model, which is a common feature extraction technique used in speech and audio processing. However, it does not provide information on whether MFCCs were used as a preprocessing step for the deep learning model.

Therefore, the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
