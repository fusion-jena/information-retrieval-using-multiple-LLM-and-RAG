Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of field-collected data, forest inventory data, and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. 

According to the context, field-collected data and forest inventory data are used in conjunction with remote sensing imagery to develop models for biomass estimation. Remote sensing imagery is likely collected through satellite or aerial sensors. 

Additionally, the context mentions the use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, which is a type of remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to create high-resolution 3D models of the environment. 

It is also mentioned that the quality of training samples and the layout of sampling points are crucial for constructing accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation, suggesting that surveys or field measurements may be used to collect data for training and validation purposes. 

However, the context does not provide information on the use of public datasets or other methods for collecting raw data.
