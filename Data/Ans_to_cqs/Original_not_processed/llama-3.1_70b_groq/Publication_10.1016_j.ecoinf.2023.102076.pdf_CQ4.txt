Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. In fact, the context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it does mention that "augmenting training data by oversampling of the minority class can help to alleviate" the issue of poor classification performance when the target class makes up a small proportion of text. This suggests that oversampling is a data augmentation technique that could be applied, but it is not explicitly stated as being used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
