Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention data augmentation as a technique used to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network. 

Data augmentation was performed by rotating, mirroring, and flipping the tree samples randomly. This technique can help to reduce data bias by increasing the diversity of the training data and making the model more robust to variations in the data.

Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned in the provided context. Diverse data collection is also not explicitly mentioned, but the context does mention that the study area was divided into 12 plots for field measurements, which could be a way to collect diverse data.

Therefore, the only technique mentioned in the context that can be used to address data bias is data augmentation through rotation, mirroring, and flipping of the tree samples.
