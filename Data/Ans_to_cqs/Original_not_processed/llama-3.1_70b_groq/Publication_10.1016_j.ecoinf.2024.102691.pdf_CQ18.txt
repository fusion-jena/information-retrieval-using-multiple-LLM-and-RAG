Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. Additionally, the evaluation metrics for each model on the validation set were calculated after 300 epochs. This suggests that the model performance was monitored and evaluated at regular intervals (every 300 epochs) during training, but the specific strategy or criteria used to monitor performance is not provided.
