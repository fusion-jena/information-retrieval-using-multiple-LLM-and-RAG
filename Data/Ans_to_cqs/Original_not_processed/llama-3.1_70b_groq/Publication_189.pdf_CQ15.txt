Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the learning rate (Î±) used for heads layer training as 0.001 and that it decays by 10 during all layers training, but it does not specify the optimization algorithm used (e.g., SGD, Adam). Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
