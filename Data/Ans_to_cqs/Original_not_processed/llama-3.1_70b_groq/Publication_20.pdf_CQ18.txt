Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the network training was stopped after 70 epochs to prevent overfitting. This suggests that the model's performance was likely monitored during training to determine when to stop, but the specific strategy used is not described.
