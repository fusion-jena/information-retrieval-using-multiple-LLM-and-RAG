Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on comparing the performance of different covariate selection procedures and modeling algorithms, specifically Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Random Forest (RF), in the context of ecological informatics.
