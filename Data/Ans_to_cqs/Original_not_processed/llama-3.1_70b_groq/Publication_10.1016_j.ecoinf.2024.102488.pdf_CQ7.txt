Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of a five-fold cross-validation process in the RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation) method for feature selection.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of training samples and validation samples, which are listed in Table 2. The table shows the number of training samples and validation samples for each class, but it does not provide information on how the data was split.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a meta-model and the combination of predictions from different base models, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to split the data for training and validation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
