Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the process of classifying bird songs using machine learning and the structure of the metadata file used for training the CNN and k-NN. It does mention that the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets to reduce variability between tests, but it does not provide information on how randomness was handled during the training process. Therefore, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
