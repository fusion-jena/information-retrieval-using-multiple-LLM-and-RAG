Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention that S. P. Sankareshwaran et al. proposed the CAHA-AXRNet approach, which optimizes hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm. But this is not related to the BEiT model mentioned in the context. Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the BEiT model are optimized.
