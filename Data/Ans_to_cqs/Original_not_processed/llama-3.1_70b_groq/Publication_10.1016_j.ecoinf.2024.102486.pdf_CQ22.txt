Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics of a deep learning model. It discusses the performance of machines and GPUs in terms of execution times, speedup factors, and memory transfer properties such as latency and bandwidth. It also explains the concepts of compute-bound and memory-bound applications, but it does not provide information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
