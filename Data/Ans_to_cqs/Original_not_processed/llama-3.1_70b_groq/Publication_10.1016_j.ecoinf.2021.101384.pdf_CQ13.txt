The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions that the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data is aggregated at a 0.01Â° resolution with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model, but it does not provide any details about the model's architecture or hyperparameters.
