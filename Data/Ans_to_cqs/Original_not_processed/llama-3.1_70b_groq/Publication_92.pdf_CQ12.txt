Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the architecture of the network follows the GoogLeNet's architecture with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. This is mentioned in the provided context as "The architecture of our network follows the GoogLeNet’s with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classiﬁer."
