Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the task of few-shot sound event detection, discussing various approaches, architectures, and techniques used to address challenges related to this task.

However, it can be inferred that some of the systems submitted to the public challenge may have employed techniques to handle randomness, such as using fixed random seeds or averaging results over multiple runs with different seeds. But without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.

Some of the systems mentioned in the context, such as Du_NERCSLIP and Wolters et al. (2021), used neural network architectures specifically trained to infer and output region annotations, but there is no mention of how they handled randomness in their pipelines.

In summary, the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
