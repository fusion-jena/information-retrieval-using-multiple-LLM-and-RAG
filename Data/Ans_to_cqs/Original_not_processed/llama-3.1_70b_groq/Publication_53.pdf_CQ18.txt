Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of a validation dataset. The dataset was split into an 80-20% ratio for training and validation, respectively. This means that 80% of the data was used for training the model, and 20% was used for validation. The model's performance was evaluated on the validation dataset during training, and the error rate, validation loss, and training loss were tracked. Specifically, it is mentioned that at epoch 5, the model achieved an error rate of 0.1538 (15.38%), a validation loss of 0.4211, and a training loss. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated at each epoch, allowing for adjustments to be made as needed.
