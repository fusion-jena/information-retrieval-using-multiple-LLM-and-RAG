Answer: According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data include:

1. Remotely sensed imagery: High-resolution remotely sensed imagery is used for monitoring ecosystem service change, as mentioned in the study by Huang et al. (2019).
2. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of public datasets such as the HWSD (Harmonized World Soil Database) and the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids.
3. Direct acquisition: The context mentions direct acquisition of data through various means, including surveys and reclassification by ArcGIS 10.8.
4. Online sources: The context provides links to online sources such as http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-datatabase and https://www.resdc.cn/, which may be used for collecting raw data.

It is not clear from the provided context whether sensors are used for collecting raw data. However, the context does mention the use of remotely sensed imagery, which may involve the use of sensors.
