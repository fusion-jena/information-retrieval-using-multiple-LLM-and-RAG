Answer: 

The text does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a data set sampler that upsamples and duplicates randomly selected samples and augments them, which can help to alleviate class imbalance and potentially reduce overfitting. Furthermore, the text mentions the use of a focal loss function, which can help to reduce the impact of class imbalance and potentially reduce overfitting.
