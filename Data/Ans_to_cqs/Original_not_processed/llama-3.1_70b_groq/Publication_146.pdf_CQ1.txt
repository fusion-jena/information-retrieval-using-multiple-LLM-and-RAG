Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that due to the lack of existing quality data, the authors had to create their own dataset for the project. This suggests that the authors may have collected the data themselves, possibly through methods such as aerial images processing or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collection. However, the exact methods used for collecting the raw data are not specified in the provided context.
