Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Initial learning rate: 0.01 for all models except MnasNet, which was initially set at 0.1
- Learning rate reduction: The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after steps of 30 epochs
- Batch normalization: Used in all models
- Number of epochs: 150

Note that the specific hyperparameters may vary across different models, but the above-mentioned hyperparameters are the common ones used across all models.
