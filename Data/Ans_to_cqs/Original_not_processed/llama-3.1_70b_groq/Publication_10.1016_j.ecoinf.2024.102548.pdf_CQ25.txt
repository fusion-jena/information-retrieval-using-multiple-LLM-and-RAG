Answer: The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context, specifically ResNet-50 and InceptionV3, is for classification tasks. This is evident from the related work section (2) which mentions that the evaluation of model performance was based on the accuracy metric, and the class mode was set to 'categorical' for multi-class classification tasks. Additionally, the description of ResNet-50 and InceptionV3 in sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5, respectively, highlights their strong performance in image classification tasks.
