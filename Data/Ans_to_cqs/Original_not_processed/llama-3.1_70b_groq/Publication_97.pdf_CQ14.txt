Answer: 
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid search. According to the provided context, the researchers tested different combinations of parameters, which correspond to different U-Net architectures, and performed a grid search over 216 different U-Net-like architectures. This approach allowed them to find several of the best architectures suitable for forest damage segmentation.
