Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it describes a custom dataset consisting of 426,876 images of pollen grains, covering 35 species, and split into training, validation, and testing sets in the proportions 80:10:10. This dataset was specifically created for the task of pollen species identification using deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
