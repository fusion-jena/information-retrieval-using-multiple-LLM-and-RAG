Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of multi-temporal data, Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation, and transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-34 model, but it does not specify any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
