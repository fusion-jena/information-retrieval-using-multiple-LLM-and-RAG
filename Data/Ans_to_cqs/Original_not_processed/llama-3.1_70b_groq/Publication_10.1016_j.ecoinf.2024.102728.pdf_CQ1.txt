Answer:::

The provided context mentions several methods utilized for collecting raw data, which can be relevant to a deep learning pipeline. These methods include:

1. Archaeological survey data: The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) conducted surveys, which provided data for the study.
2. Remotely sensed data: This includes data from spaceborne sensors (VENÎ¼S), airborne sensors (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
3. Digital maps: The Israeli Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) provided digital maps for modern land use/land cover (LU/LC).
4. Georegistered orthophotos: The Survey of Israel (SOI) provided high-resolution orthophotos (12.5 cm) for georeferencing and masking the study area.
5. Substrate data: The Israel geological survey (I.G.S.) and soil data from Ravikovitch (1969) were used for geological and soil information.
6. Climate-related data: The Israel Meteorological Service (I.M.S.) and the US (no specific source mentioned) provided climate-related data.

These data sources can be used as raw data in a deep learning pipeline, especially for applications related to land use/land cover classification, object detection, or other environmental monitoring tasks. However, it is essential to note that the specific deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context (Mohedano et al., 2017) is focused on object retrieval, and the data sources mentioned might not be directly applicable to that specific task.
