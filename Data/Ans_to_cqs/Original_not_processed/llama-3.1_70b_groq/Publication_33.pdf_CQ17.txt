Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does reference a paper by Sarle (1996) titled "Stopped training and other remedies for overfitting" (reference 45), which suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of overfitting and have considered methods to address it.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a single parameter to calibrate Deep Learning models, which could potentially be related to regularization. However, without further information, it is unclear what specific regularization methods are used.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, but I can suggest that the authors may have used methods such as early stopping, as mentioned in the referenced paper, or other regularization techniques that are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
