Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited, and that implementing a U-Net model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python removed the requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. This suggests that the use of pre-trained models and transfer learning may be employed to mitigate the effects of limited data.

Additionally, the context mentions that the U-Net implemented through arcgis.learn is pre-trained on ImageNet, which may help to improve classification accuracies. However, this is not a technique specifically used to address data bias.

The context does not mention stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection as techniques used to address data bias. It is possible that these techniques may have been employed, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that the use of pre-trained models and transfer learning may be employed to mitigate the effects of limited data.
