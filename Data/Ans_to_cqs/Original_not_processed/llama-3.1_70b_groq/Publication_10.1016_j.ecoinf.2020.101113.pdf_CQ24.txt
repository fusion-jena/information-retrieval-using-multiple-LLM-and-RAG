Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of bird species recognition from audio recordings. It discusses the importance of data preprocessing, the use of pre-trained models, and the potential benefits of data augmentation. However, it does not address the topic of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
