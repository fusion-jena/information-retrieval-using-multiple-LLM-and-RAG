Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is k-fold cross-validation. According to the provided context, the development dataset is divided into k groups, and during each iteration, one group is used as the tuning dataset, while the remaining groups are used as the training dataset. The model is developed using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. This process is repeated k times, and the average performance of the k models represents the performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyperparameters. This approach helps to evaluate the model's performance and identify the best hyperparameters.
