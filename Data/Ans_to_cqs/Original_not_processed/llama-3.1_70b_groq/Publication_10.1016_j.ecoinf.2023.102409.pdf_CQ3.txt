Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention various deep learning algorithms and architectures, such as U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (Pspnet), and DeepLabV3+, which are commonly used for image segmentation tasks.

The context also mentions the use of semantic segmentation tasks, which typically involve annotating pixels or regions of interest in images. However, the specific annotation techniques used are not specified.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
