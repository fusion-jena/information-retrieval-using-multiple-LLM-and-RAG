Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a validation dataset to evaluate the accuracy of the model. This suggests that some form of data splitting was used, but the specific details are not provided.

There is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure generalizability. The context only mentions that the model was trained on the entire dataset for 1000 epochs after selecting the best hyperparameters, and that a validation dataset was used to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
