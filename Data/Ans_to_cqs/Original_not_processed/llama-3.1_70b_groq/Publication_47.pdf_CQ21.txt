Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the authors performed cross-validation by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed, but the specific details are not provided.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors used the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models to predict the conservation status of all orchid species. This implies that some form of model evaluation or comparison was performed, but the specific metrics or methods used are not specified.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the model training and evaluation process, it does not provide detailed information about the postprocessing steps involved.
