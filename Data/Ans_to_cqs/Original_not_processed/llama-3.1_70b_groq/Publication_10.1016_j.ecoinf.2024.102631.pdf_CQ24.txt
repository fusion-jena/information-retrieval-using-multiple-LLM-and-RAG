Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of a neural network, including the use of Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) modules, decoder blocks, and loss functions. It does not discuss methods for managing randomness or ensuring reproducibility in the training process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
