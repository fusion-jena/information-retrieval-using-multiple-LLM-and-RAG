Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text only mentions that the authors plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the future, pending data availability. However, it does not provide information on the specific frameworks that will be used to build these models.
