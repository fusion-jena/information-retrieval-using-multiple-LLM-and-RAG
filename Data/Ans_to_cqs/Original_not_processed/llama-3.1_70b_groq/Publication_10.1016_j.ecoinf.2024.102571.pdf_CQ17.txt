Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to environmental and wastewater treatment topics, and the only mention of a neural network is in the Uzlu (2021) paper, which uses a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a specific architecture and activation functions. However, it does not discuss regularization methods. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
