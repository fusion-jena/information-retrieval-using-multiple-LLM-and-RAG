Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model residuals obtained in each run were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. Additionally, the mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements is reported, along with the 95% confidence interval.

In the case of the simple linear model (LM) and the generalized linear model (GLM), the metrics used to evaluate their performance are:

* R-squared (coefficient of determination) on the training data
* Mean absolute difference (or deviance) on the test data

These metrics provide an indication of how well the models fit the data and how accurate their predictions are. However, it is not clear if these metrics are also used to evaluate the performance of the ANN model.
