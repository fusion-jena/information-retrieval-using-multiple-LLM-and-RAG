Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of random seed values or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the training protocol for the deep learning architectures. This implies that randomness is introduced in the training process through the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a momentum value of 0.9, which is a common technique used in SGD to help stabilize the training process and reduce the impact of randomness. However, it does not provide information on whether a fixed random seed value is used to ensure reproducibility of the results.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that stochastic gradient descent is used to introduce randomness in the training process, and momentum is used to stabilize the training process. However, the use of a fixed random seed value is not explicitly mentioned.
