Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as average unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies, which were reported to be 98.9% and 97.4%, respectively. Additionally, the F1-score for the training dataset was reported to be 0.980. These metrics suggest that the model's performance was evaluated using a combination of accuracy and F1-score. However, the specific strategy or methodology used to monitor the model's performance during training is not provided.
