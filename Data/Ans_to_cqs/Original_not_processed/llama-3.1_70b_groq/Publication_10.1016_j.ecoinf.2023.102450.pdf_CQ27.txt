Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and evaluation of the model, as well as the experimental setup and results. It does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment-related processes.

However, it is mentioned that the experiments were performed on a personal computer with a 1060Ti GPU and an Ubuntu 20.04 operating system, and that CUDA v10.1 was used to accelerate the processing speed. Additionally, Python version 3.7 and various libraries such as PyTorch, NumPy, and OpenCV were used. But this information is related to the training and testing of the model, not its deployment.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
