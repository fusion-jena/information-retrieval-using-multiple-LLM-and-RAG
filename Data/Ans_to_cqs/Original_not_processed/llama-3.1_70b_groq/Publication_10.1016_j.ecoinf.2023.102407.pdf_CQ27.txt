Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the development of a novel invasive Species Distribution Prediction scheme called SDP-EPL, which uses an ensemble teacher model to incrementally generate pseudo-labels. It also mentions various studies and references related to species distribution modeling, machine learning, and pseudo-labeling. However, it does not provide information on model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query.
