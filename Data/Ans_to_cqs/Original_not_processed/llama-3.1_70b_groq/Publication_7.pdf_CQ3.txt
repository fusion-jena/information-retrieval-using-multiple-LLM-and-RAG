Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. It mentions that the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas, is used to fine-tune the weights of the deep network. However, it does not provide details on the annotation techniques used to create this dataset.

The context does mention that the goal of the proposed framework is to enable automatic counting, sizing, and movement tracking of specific marine organisms, which suggests that the annotation techniques used may involve object detection or instance segmentation. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context.
