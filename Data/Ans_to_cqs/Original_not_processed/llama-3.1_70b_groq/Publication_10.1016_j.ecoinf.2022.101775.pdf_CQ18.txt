Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use a validation set, which consists of 10% of the data. This validation set is used to check for overfitting during the training process. Additionally, a min-max scaler is used, which is reverted at the end to compute the performance metrics in the test set. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set during training, and the performance metrics are computed on the test set after training is complete.
