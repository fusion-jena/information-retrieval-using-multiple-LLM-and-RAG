Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be focused on data citation, data repositories, and data stewardship, particularly in the context of the ESS-DIVE repository and the ESS program. It discusses the challenges of citing large collections of data packages, the importance of providing credit to data producers, and the potential solutions for data collection authorship. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
