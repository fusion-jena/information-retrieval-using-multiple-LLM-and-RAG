Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the structure of the CNN and LSTM models, the performance of different models, and the challenges and future directions for improving the Zhoushan fishery algal bloom forecasting model.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been involved, as the context mentions the use of time series data and the performance of different models on different Chl concentration regions. Typically, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential for preparing time series data for deep learning models.

But without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to the query. Therefore, I must say that I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
