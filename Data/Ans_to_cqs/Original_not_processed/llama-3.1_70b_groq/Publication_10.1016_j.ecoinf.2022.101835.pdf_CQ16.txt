Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters and their ranges used for optimizing the machine learning models, as well as the evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, and R2) used to compare the performance of the models. It does not provide information on the stopping criteria or convergence conditions used during training. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
