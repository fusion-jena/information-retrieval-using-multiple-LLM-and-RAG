Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research article discussing the application of deep convolutional neural networks to digitized natural history collections, but it does not include any information about the code repository. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
