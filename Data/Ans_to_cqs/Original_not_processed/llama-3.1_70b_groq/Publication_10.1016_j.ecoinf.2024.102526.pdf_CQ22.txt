Answer::: 

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the planning and execution of a study involving image capture and analysis, possibly in the field of ecology or biology. It includes information about the study's spatial and temporal extent, sampling protocols, image capture settings, and data curation. However, it does not provide information about the use of deep learning models or their evaluation metrics.
