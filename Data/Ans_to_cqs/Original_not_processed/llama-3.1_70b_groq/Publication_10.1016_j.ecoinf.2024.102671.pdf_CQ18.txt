Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to ecological modeling, conservation planning, and spatial analysis, but it does not provide information on the training process or performance monitoring of a model.

However, it does mention the importance of cross-validation in assessing the generalizability and robustness of ecological zoning models (Roberts et al., 2017). It also suggests that future studies could focus on using statistical and machine learning techniques to model the relationship between landscape features and ecological carbon sink capabilities, and implement cross-validation techniques to assess the predictive accuracy and robustness of each zoning method.

But it does not provide a specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training.
