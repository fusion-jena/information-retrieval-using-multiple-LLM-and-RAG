Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context only discusses the model development, specifically the use of linear regression to model AGBD (Above-Ground Biomass Density) using Sentinel-2 data, and the evaluation of the model using metrics such as RMSE, R2, MAE, and bias. It does not provide information on postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
