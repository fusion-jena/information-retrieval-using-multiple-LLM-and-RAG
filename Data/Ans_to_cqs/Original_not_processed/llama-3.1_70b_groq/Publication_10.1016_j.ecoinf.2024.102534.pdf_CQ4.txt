Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of authors and their contributions to a research paper or project, including tasks such as writing, review, editing, supervision, investigation, and data curation. There is no mention of deep learning, data augmentation, or specific techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
