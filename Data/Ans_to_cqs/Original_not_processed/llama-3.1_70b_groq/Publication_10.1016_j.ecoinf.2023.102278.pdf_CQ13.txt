Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are partially mentioned in the provided context. According to the text, the Adam optimizer was chosen after comparing with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 1.0⋅10^-4, weight decay of 1.0⋅10^-3, and momentum of 1.0⋅10^-3. The Adam optimizer outperformed SGD with a 1%–2% increase in accuracy. However, the context does not provide information on other hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, or regularization techniques.
