Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to focus on the development of synthetic data models for reef restoration decision support, discussing the challenges of generating synthetic data, the importance of defining a narrow scope for the application of the models, and the iterative improvement of the models. It does mention the use of data utility metrics, including Ï‡2 test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Correlations scores, Mean data quality score, and Mean data diagnostics scores, but it does not elaborate on the postprocessing steps involved in the model training process. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
