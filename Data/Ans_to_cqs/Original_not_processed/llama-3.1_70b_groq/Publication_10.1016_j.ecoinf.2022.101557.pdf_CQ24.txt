Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of random sampling to select validation samples from the training set to prevent overfitting. Specifically, it states that "These samples are selected randomly from all areas that are used in the training set, and are never used to fit the model."

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Dropout with a rate of 0.3 during training to make the model more stable. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

It also mentions the use of ADAM optimization with a learning rate of 0.0001 to find optimal weights in the neural network. ADAM is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does describe several strategies that are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including random sampling, Dropout, and ADAM optimization.
