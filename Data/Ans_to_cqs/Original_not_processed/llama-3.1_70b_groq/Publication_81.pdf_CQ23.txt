Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers employed Elastic Net to address the problem of overfitting caused by the small dataset. The Elastic Net provides sparse connection, which can also save training time. Additionally, the model uses a deep learning approach to extract useful features and classify fish from different families, which is effective and robust.

However, the provided context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting as measures to ensure the generalizability of the model. It only mentions the use of Elastic Net to improve the generalization ability of the ESK model.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the model outperforms four commonly used machine learning methods, and the results show the effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed model for fish classification. However, the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability are limited to the use of Elastic Net.
