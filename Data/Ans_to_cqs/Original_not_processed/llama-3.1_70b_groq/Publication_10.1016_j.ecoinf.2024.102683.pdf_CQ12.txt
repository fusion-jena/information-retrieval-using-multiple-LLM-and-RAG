Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model. Specifically, the proposed approach, SCAM-Herb model, uses a CNN-based method to identify plants. Additionally, the model incorporates attention mechanisms, including Channel Attention (CA) and Spatial Attention (SA), to enhance its performance. The model also uses a Bayesian optimizer to control the output of each CNN and evaluate the optimal augment policies for data augmentation.
