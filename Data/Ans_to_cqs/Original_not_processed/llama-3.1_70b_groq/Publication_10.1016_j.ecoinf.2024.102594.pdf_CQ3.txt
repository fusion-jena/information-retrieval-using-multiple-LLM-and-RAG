Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the process of preparing the dataset for training the DeepLabV3+ model.

According to the context, the remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes are cut into a series of regular image blocks for input. The cropping size is set to 32 × 32 pixels with a redundancy rate of 0.5. The training set is then enhanced through various techniques, including:

* Flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis
* Exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged
* Randomly rotating the images and labels by 90°
* Randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged

These techniques suggest that the dataset is annotated with semantic labels, which are used to train the DeepLabV3+ model for semantic segmentation. However, the specific annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, but it appears that semantic labeling is used to annotate the dataset.
