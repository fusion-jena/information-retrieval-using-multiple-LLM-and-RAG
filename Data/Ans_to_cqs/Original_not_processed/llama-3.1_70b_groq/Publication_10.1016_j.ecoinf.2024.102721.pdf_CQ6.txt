Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a research article focused on forecasting ecological water demand using deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models. It discusses the structure of the LSTM model, scenario analysis, and references other research papers, but does not provide information on preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this study.
