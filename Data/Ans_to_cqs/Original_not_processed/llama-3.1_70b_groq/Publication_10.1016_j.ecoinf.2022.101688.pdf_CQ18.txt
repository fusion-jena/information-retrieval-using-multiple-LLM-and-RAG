Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing hyper-parameters, testing files, and the performance of different network architectures on various datasets. It mentions that the performance of the network was computed on each testing file and reported on the F1-score, but it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training.
