Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on pollination models, land use/land cover classification, and fuzzy inference systems, but it does not discuss deep learning or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
