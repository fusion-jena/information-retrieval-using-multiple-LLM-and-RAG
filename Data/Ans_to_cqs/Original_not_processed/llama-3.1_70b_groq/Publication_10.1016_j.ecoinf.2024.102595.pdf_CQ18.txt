Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is hyper-parameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10). This approach allows for the evaluation of different combinations of hyper-parameters and the selection of the optimal set that results in the best model performance. Additionally, the division of the preprocessed data into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%) enables the assessment of the model's performance on unseen data during the validation phase, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.
