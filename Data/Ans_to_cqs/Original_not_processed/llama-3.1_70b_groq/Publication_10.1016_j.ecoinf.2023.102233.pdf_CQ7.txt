Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:

* The training/validation dataset comprised 6363 hours of audio from ten independent sites, while the test dataset comprised 2735 hours of audio from nine independent sites that were different from the training/validation dataset.
* Each successive model iteration was trained on 70% of the training data and validated against 30% of the training data. This train/validation split approach is used to minimize potential overfitting of the model on small sample sizes.
* A separate test dataset was used for final testing/evaluation of the model.

It is also mentioned that the authors chose to use a train/validation split approach instead of cross-validation, as it is more suitable for small sample sizes. The F1 score was used as the validation metric, which includes information on both model precision and recall.
