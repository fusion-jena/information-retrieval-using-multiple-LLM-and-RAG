Answer:

The pipeline uses various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Specifically, the models mentioned in the context are:

1. ResNet-50: a CNN model that uses skip connections to improve performance.
2. Inception-V3: a CNN model used for image classification, which has an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer.
3. Vision Transformer (ViT): a Transformer-based model that uses an attention mechanism to learn what parts of the input to attend to.

These models are used for image classification tasks, and the pipeline also mentions the use of class weights in the cross-entropy loss function to deal with dataset imbalance.
