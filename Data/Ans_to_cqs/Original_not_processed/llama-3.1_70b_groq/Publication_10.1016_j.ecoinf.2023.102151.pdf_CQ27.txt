Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on soil science, irrigation, and visualization tools, with some references to node-based programming and computational operations. There is no mention of deep learning models or their deployment. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to this query.
