Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on active learning strategies, sampling methods, and the use of transfer learning models for classification tasks. It does not discuss data preprocessing techniques or methods for addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of clustering for diversity sampling, which could potentially be related to addressing data bias. But it is not explicitly stated as a technique for addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
