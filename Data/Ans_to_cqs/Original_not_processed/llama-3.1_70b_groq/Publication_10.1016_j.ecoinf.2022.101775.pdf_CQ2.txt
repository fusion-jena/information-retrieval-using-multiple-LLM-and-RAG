Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the application of deep learning techniques, such as matrix factorization and embedding layers, to data generated by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It mentions the use of sensors and time instants as input data, but does not specify the format of this data.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the data is likely to be in a tabular or numerical format, such as CSV, as it is being used for tasks like matrix factorization and collaborative filtering. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in the pipeline.
