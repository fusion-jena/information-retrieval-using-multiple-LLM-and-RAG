Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the calculation of performance metrics, including Sensitivity and Specificity, which are presented in Table 1.

The context also mentions that the predicted vector is processed and logged to the site for review, but it does not provide further details on the specific postprocessing steps involved. Additionally, it mentions the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the trained model, but it does not provide information on the calculation of a Confusion matrix or the use of Saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of performance metrics, including Sensitivity and Specificity. Other postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of a Confusion matrix or the use of Saliency maps, are not mentioned and cannot be confirmed.
