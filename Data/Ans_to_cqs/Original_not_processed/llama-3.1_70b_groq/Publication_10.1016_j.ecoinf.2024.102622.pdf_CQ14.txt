Answer: I don't know. The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various vegetation indices (VIs) and their relationship with chlorophyll content and crop coverage, as well as the performance of different machine learning models (MLR, RF, SVM, MLP, and XGboost) in predicting these variables. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.
