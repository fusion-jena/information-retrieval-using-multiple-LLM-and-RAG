Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline primarily deals with image data, specifically thermal images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The context mentions "UAV thermal images" and "feature maps" extracted from these images, indicating that the pipeline is designed to process and analyze visual data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the pipeline. Additionally, CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a format typically used for tabular data, which is not mentioned in the context.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data, specifically thermal images from UAVs.
