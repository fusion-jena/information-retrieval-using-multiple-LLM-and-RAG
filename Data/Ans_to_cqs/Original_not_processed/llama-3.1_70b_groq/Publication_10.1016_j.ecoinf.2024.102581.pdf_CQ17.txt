Answer: 

The provided context mentions only one regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, which is dropout. According to the text, "Dropout is used to help the model reduce the gap between the training and validation results and improve its generalizability." This suggests that dropout is used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps the model to generalize better to unseen data.

There is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context. Therefore, I can only confirm the use of dropout as a regularization method, but I do not have information about other methods that may be used in the pipeline.
