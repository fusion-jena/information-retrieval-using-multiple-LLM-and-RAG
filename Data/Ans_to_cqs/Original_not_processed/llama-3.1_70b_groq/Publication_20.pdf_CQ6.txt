Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment. It also mentions that the weight initialization is a random Gaussian initialization, which is a common initialization technique used in deep learning models.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model uses a GoogLeNet architecture, which is a pre-trained model that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset. This suggests that the preprocessing steps may have been similar to those used in the ImageNet dataset, which typically involves resizing images to a fixed size, normalizing the pixel values, and possibly applying data augmentation techniques. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

Therefore, the exact preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model are not specified in the provided context.
