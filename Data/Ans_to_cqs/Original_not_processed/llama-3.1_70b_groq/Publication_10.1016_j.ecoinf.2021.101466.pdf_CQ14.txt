Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the application of random erasing to the training dataset, the use of YOLOv4 and EfficientNet, and references several research papers, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
