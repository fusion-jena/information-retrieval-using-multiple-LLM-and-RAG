Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some methods used to account for biases in biodiversity datasets, such as using dataset-specific weights or factor interactions to account for differences in included datasets. Additionally, it mentions the use of prior knowledge of the biology of a species to "nudge" or constrain response functions towards a more sensible outcome.

Regarding the specific techniques mentioned in the query, the context does not mention Stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it does mention the use of a dedicated model that combines multiple presence-only and presence-absence datasets together through a joint likelihood in a Bayesian setting, which could potentially be used to address data bias.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the importance of considering all available data to address biases and sampling methods that can differ between datasets. However, it does not provide specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

In summary, while the context provides some information on addressing biases in biodiversity datasets, it does not specifically mention the techniques mentioned in the query.
