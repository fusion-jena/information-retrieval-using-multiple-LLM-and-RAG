Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, specifically the use of the MaxEnt model to predict species distributions. It discusses the contribution of environmental and territorial variables to the model, as well as references to relevant research papers. There is no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques, so I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
