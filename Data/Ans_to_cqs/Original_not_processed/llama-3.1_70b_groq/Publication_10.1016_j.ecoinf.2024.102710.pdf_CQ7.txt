Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to focus on the use of transfer learning models, active learning strategies, and the evaluation of these models on specific datasets. It does mention that van Osta et al. (2023) used a small validation set of 6.25 hours, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation in general. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
