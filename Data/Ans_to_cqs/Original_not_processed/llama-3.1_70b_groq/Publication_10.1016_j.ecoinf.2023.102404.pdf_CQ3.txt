Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for remote sensing and geospatial analysis, but it does not delve into the specifics of data annotation techniques.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of techniques such as stratified random sampling for splitting data into training and testing sets, which is a common practice in machine learning. But this is not directly related to data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I must conclude that the provided context does not provide enough information to answer the query about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Answer: I don't know.
