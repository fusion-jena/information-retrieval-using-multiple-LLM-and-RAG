Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization techniques employed, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
