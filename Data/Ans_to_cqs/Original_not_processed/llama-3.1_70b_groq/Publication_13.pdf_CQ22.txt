Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are accuracy and classification error. The accuracy is measured as the proportion of correctly classified images, and the classification error is visualized as a scaled confusion matrix. Additionally, the performance of the model is also evaluated using the average accuracy reduction, which indicates the difference in performance between the within-dataset prediction accuracy and the between-dataset prediction accuracy. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model include:

* Accuracy (Acc)
* Classification error
* Average accuracy reduction (Î”Acc)

Note that precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
