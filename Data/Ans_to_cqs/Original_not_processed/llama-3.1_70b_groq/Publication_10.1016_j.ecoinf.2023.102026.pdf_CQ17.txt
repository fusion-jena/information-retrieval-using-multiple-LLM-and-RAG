Answer:::

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily discusses random forest (RF) algorithms, their advantages, and their application in species distribution modeling (SDMs). It also touches on the importance of resampling techniques, such as bootstrapping, in improving model precision.

However, it does mention that RF algorithms can overcome limitations of Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs), including model overfitting. But it does not provide information on specific regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
