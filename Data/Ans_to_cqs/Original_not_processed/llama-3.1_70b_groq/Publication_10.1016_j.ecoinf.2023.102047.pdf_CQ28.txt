Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning models. It discusses various studies that used deep learning models to estimate seagrass coverage, map seagrass distribution, and identify seagrass meadows, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The context only mentions the models used, such as encoder-decoder models, deep capsule networks, convolutional neural networks, and Faster R-CNN, but it does not mention the platform used to deploy these models.
