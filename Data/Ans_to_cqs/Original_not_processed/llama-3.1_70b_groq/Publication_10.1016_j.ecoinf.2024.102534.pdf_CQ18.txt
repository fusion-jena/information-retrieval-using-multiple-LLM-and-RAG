Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS). These metrics were used to assess the performance of model predictions. Additionally, the threshold value of 0.6 was derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify suitable and unsuitable areas.
