Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. However, it does mention a simple augmentation strategy used during the training stage, which involves flipping the patches horizontally and vertically with a 50% probability. This suggests that the pipeline may be using randomization to augment the training data, but the specific strategies used to handle randomness are not detailed.

Additionally, the context mentions that the pipeline is trained and assessed using a dataset called PST - Pest Sticky Traps, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled during the training process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value.
