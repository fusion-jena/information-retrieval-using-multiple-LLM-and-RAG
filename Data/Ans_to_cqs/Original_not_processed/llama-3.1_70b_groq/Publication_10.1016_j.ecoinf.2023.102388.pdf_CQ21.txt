Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of overfitting, the vulnerability of models to privacy attacks, and the process of training an attack model to mimic the behavior of a target model.

However, it does mention the extraction of prediction vectors for each data point after the training of the attack model is finished. But this is not directly related to the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
