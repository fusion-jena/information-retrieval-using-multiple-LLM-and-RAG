Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps. However, it does mention the use of a confusion matrix to assess the classification accuracy of the model.

According to the context, the confusion matrix was used to quickly observe the performance of the model on each category and calculate the accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators of each category. The confusion matrix was normalized in the row direction, with the 6 rows and 6 columns representing 6 categories, respectively.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and other evaluation indicators, but it does not provide further details on the specific metrics used.

Therefore, the only postprocessing step mentioned in the context is the calculation of the confusion matrix and the evaluation of the model's performance using various metrics. There is no mention of Saliency maps or other postprocessing steps.
