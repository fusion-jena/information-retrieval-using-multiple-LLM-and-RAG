Answer: The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that "it is customary to randomise the dataset before splitting when there is a class imbalance - stratification; but since this problem is like a time-series problem..." This suggests that the problem does not involve class imbalance, and therefore stratification may not be necessary. However, the exact criteria used for splitting the data into training, test, and validation sets is not specified.
