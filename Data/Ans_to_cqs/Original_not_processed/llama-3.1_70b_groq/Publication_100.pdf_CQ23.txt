Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained on large data sets, which could potentially contribute to its generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. This suggests that the model was trained with a validation set, which is a common practice to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.

It is also worth noting that the model was trained with weight decay, which is a form of regularization that can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability. However, without more information, it is difficult to say what other measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the model's training process, it does not provide a complete picture of the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.
