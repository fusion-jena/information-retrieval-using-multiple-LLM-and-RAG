Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses various deep learning models, including ResNet, Wide-ResNet, InceptionV3, and MnasNet, and their architectures, as well as the training process and optimizer used. It also mentions the application of deep learning techniques in computer vision, including insect detection and identification. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
