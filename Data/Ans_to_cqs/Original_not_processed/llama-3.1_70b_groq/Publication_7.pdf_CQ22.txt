Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of deep neural networks, specifically VGGnet, for image classification and the application of color channel stretch for pre-processing. It also mentions the use of the Benthoz15 dataset and the Western Australia (WA) subset for training the classifier. However, it does not provide information on the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

The context does mention that the resulting intensities achieved a better performance compared to the original ones after applying color channel stretch, but it does not specify what performance metric was used to make this comparison. Additionally, the text mentions that image representations extracted from deep neural networks have shown state-of-art performance in numerous image classification problems, but it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics used to determine this.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
