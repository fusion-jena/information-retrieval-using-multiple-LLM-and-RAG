Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be focused on remote sensing and LAI (Leaf Area Index) estimation using various algorithms and techniques, but it does not specifically discuss data augmentation techniques used in deep learning. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this question.
