Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset is small and that the authors used a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach to train and validate their models. This approach involves omitting a complete 450m multitemporal transect from the training process and subsequently testing it, which may help to mitigate some effects of data bias.

Additionally, the context mentions that the authors tripled the image pool for each transect by incorporating multi-temporal data from a three-month span across three environments. This could be seen as a form of data augmentation, which can help to increase the diversity of the dataset and potentially reduce data bias.

However, it does not mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I do not know what specific techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
