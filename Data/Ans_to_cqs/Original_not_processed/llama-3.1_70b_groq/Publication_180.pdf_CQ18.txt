Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves considering two factors: 1) correct identification rate, and 2) processing time. The correct identification rate improved up to a certain point and then reached a plateau, beyond which no significant improvement was seen. The processing time, on the other hand, showed a positive linear relationship with the number of training steps. The model performance was monitored by tracking these two factors and identifying the point at which the correct identification rate plateaued and the processing time increased significantly. This approach allowed the researchers to determine the optimum number of training steps for the Mexican and Brazilian datasets, which were 2,000 and 12,000 steps, respectively.
