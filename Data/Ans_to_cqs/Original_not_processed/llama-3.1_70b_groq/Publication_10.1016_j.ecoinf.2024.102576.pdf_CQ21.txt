Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data preparation, model training, and classification process using the U-Net model for land-cover classification. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps that are typically performed after model training.

However, it does mention that the trained model can be used to classify target PSI data, and that the classification can be continued using the model if satellite imagery accumulates due to continuous satellite observations. But it does not elaborate on the evaluation metrics or postprocessing techniques used to assess the model's performance.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
