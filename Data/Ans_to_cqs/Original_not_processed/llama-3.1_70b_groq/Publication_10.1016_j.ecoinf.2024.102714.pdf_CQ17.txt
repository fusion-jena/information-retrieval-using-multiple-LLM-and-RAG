Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to habitat classification and mapping, and the machine learning model used is an XGBoostClassifier, which is an ensemble learning method. However, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting are not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
