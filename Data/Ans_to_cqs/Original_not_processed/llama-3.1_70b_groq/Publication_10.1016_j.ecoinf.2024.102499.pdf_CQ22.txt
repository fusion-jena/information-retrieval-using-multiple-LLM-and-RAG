Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are recall, precision, and F-measure. These metrics are computed for each model, and the results are presented in a boxplot representation (Fig. 1). The recall, precision, and F-measure are calculated using the following formulas:

Recall = Tpi / (Tpi + Fni)
Precision = Tpi / (Tpi + Fpi)
F-measure = 2 * (Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

where Tpi is the number of true positives, Fpi is the number of false positives, and Fni is the number of false negatives for species i.
