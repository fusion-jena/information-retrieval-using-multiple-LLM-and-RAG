Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly in the context of ecological informatics and predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. It discusses various definitions and terms used to describe variants of noise and scarceness of labels, as well as a new computational setting for regression with structurally incomplete target labels. However, it does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
