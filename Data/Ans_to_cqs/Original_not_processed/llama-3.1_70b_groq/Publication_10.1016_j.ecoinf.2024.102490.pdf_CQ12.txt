Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline, nor does it specify the type of model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). The context appears to be related to ecological and climate modeling, and mentions various statistical and machine learning techniques such as Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Generalized Linear Models, but does not provide information on deep learning models.
