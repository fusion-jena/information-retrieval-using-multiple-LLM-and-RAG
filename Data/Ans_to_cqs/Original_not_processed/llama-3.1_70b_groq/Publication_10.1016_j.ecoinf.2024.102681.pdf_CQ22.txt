Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN after embedding LSTM into the CNN. This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance. However, it does not provide information on other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1-score.
