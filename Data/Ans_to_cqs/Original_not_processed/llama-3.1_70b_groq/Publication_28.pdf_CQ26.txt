Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the structure and training of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and their application in deep learning, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it does mention that no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study, as stated in the data availability statement. This suggests that the context may not be relevant to the query about data preprocessing and bias mitigation techniques.

If you're looking for information on techniques to address data bias, some common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, as you mentioned. However, these techniques are not discussed in the provided context.
