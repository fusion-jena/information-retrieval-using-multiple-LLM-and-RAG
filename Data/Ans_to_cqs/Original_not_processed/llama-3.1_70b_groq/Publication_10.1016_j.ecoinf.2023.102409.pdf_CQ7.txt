Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context discusses the architecture and parameters of the deep learning models used, such as the initial learning rate, number of iterations, batch size, and optimizer, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
