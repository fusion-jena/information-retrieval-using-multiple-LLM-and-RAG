Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation of the model's performance using certain metrics.

According to the context, the model's performance was assessed using the typical indicator series: true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). The context also mentions the calculation of precision (P) and recall (R) using these indicators.

The precision (P) is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, as shown in Equation 1. The recall (R) is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using a decision threshold Î¸ to define the predictions as positive (presence) or negative (absence). However, it does not provide further details on the postprocessing steps involved.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of precision (P) and recall (R) using the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. However, the context does not provide information on Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
