Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be related to land use/land cover classification and forest fire risk assessment using XGBoost and other machine learning techniques, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
