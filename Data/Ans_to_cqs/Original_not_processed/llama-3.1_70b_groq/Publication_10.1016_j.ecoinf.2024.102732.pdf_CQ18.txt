Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various modeling techniques, such as Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR), and their parameter tuning methods, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
