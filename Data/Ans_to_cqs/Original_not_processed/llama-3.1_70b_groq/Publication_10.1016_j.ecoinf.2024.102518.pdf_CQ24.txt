Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context appears to be focused on species distribution modeling, ecology, and conservation biology, with references to specific research papers and studies.

However, I can provide some general information on handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various sources, such as random weight initialization, dropout, and data shuffling. To handle this randomness, researchers often employ strategies such as:

* Setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results
* Using techniques like data augmentation to reduce overfitting
* Averaging model predictions over multiple runs with different random seeds
* Using ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models trained with different random seeds

These strategies can help reduce the impact of randomness on model performance and improve the reliability of results. However, without more specific information on the deep learning pipeline in question, it is difficult to provide more tailored advice.

In the context of the provided references, I did not find any information on deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness. If you have any further questions or would like more information on species distribution modeling or ecology, I would be happy to try and assist you.
