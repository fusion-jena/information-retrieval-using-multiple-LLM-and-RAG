Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for estimating carbon stocks, the study area, and the methodology used, but it does not provide information on where the data repository is hosted. The references cited also do not provide any information on the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
