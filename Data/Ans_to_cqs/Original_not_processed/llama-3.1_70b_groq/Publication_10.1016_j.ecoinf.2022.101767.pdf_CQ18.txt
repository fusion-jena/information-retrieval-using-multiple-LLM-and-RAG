Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on analyzing YouTube videos that contain wild bird species, and it discusses the methodology and results of the study. There is no mention of a model or its training process, so I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
