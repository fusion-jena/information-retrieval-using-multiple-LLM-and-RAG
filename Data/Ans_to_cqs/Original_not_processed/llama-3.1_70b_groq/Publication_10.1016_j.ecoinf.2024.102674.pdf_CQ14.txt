Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the specific hyperparameters used for the Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Boosting Model (GBM) algorithms, such as the number of trees, minimum size of terminal nodes, shrinkage, and interaction parameters. However, it does not provide information on the optimization process itself.

Therefore, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, as this information is not provided in the given context.
