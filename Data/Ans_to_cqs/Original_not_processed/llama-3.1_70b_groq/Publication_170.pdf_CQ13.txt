Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context only provides information about the model architecture (AlexNet), the layers used, and the activation functions (Local Response Normalization and Rectified Linear Unit), but it does not provide details about the hyperparameters.
