Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of different machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, for estimating water quality parameters. It mentions the use of five-fold cross-validation, but it does not provide details on the specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets.

However, it is common in machine learning to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or k-fold cross-validation. The specific criteria used to split the data can depend on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used.

In this case, the context mentions that a five-fold cross-validation was conducted, which suggests that the data was split into five folds, with four folds used for training and one fold used for testing. However, the specific criteria used to split the data into these folds is not specified.
