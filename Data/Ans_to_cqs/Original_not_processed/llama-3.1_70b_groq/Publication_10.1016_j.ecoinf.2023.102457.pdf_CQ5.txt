Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. YouTube-8 M dataset: This is a preliminary version of the dataset used to train the VGGish model for general-purpose audio classification.

2. A human speech audio dataset: This dataset was used to train the Wav2Vec 2.0 model.

3. A dataset of bird vocalizations: This dataset was used to train the BirdNET model.

Note that the context does not mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in the deep learning pipeline. These datasets are commonly used for image classification tasks, but the context focuses on audio classification tasks.
