Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the equations governing the input gate, forget gate, and memory cell. It also mentions various papers related to deep learning for remote sensing data. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method is used.
