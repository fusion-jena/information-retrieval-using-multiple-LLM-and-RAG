Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and bathymetry retrieval using satellite imagery, and mentions specific datasets such as GF-6 (WFV) data from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. However, it does not provide information on deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning.
