Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and data processing techniques, particularly in the context of environmental monitoring and agricultural data analysis.

However, it does mention "analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs in Puglia surface water bodies" as part of the KDD sequence, suggesting that some form of data collection or sampling may be involved in the process. Additionally, it mentions the use of "big spatiotemporal data" which implies that the data may be collected from various sources, including sensors or other data-gathering technologies.

Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query. The context does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
