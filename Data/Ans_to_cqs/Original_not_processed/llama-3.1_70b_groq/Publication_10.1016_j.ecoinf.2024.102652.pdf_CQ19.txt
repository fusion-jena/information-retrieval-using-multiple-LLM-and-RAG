Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text discusses the training process, optimizer, loss function, and other details, but it does not mention the framework used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
