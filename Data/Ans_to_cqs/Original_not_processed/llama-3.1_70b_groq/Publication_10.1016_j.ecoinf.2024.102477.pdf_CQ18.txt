The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model performance was evaluated using the MAPE and RMSE metrics after training. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated after the training process was completed, but it does not provide information on how the performance was monitored during training.
