Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of various CNN models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Xception), data augmentation, and execution times. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques used, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions in the CNN models, which is a common choice for deep neural networks. Additionally, the context mentions the use of dropout with a dropout rate of 0.4 in the proposed model, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting.

But, regarding the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, the provided context does not provide any information.
