Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text describes the development of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model for predicting soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) using environmental covariates, but it does not provide information on how the dataset was split, whether cross-validation was used, or if any other techniques were employed to ensure the model's generalizability.

However, it is mentioned that a set of 2207 SOCS data points from 2010 to 2014 was retrieved from a database, which suggests that the model was trained on a relatively large dataset. Additionally, the text mentions that the model was developed using a general predictive function that takes into account various environmental covariates, which may help to improve the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the provided context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it suggests that the model was developed using a relatively large dataset and a general predictive function, which may help to improve its generalizability.
