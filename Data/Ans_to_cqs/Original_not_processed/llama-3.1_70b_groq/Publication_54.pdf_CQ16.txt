Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the model is retrained until it yields the highest accuracy possible on the validation and test datasets. This suggests that the training process is continued until the model's performance on the validation and test datasets reaches a satisfactory level, but the exact criteria for determining this are not specified.
