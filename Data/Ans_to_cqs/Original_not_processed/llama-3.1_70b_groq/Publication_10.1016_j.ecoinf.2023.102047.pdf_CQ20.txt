Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of the TensorFlow object detection API and the EfficientDet framework, but it does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
