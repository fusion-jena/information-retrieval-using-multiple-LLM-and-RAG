Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental variables. The context mentions the use of data from natural environment surveys, but it does not provide information on the specific data formats used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
