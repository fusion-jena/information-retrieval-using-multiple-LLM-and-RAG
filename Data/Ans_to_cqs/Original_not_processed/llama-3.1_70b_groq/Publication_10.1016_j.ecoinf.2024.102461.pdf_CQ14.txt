Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about hyperparameter optimization or model training. The context appears to be related to a research paper about fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. It includes tables and figures with data about satellite images, vegetation indices, and burnt areas, but it does not provide any information about model training or hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
