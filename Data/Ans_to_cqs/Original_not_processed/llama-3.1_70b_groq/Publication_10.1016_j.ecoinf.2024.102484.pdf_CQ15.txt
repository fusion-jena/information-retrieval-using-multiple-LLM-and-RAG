Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to land degradation, soil properties, and ecosystem service change, with a focus on remote sensing and data collection. It does not provide information on the deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
