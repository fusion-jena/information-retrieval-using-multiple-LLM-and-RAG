Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of YOLOv6, a deep learning model, for aerial animal detection, but it does not provide details on the preprocessing steps used.

However, it is mentioned that the authors used the default settings for YOLOv6, which might imply that they did not perform any additional preprocessing steps beyond what is already implemented in the model. Additionally, the text mentions that the authors experimented with different spatial resolutions of the imagery, but this is not a traditional preprocessing step.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what specific preprocessing steps were involved before training the deep learning model.
