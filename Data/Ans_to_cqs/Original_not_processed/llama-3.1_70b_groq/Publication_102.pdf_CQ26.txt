Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and training of the models, as well as their performance evaluation. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection.

However, it does mention the use of pre-trained weights based on the Imagenet dataset, which may imply that the dataset used for training the models is diverse and representative. Additionally, the context mentions the use of early stopping to avoid over-fitting, which may be related to addressing data bias, but it is not a direct technique for addressing bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
