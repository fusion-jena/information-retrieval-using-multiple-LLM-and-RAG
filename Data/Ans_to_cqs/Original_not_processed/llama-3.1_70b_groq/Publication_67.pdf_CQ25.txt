Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The model is used to classify images into different levels of tree cover in global drylands, as well as a "Non-Forest" class. The model is trained on a dataset of images with varying levels of tree cover and is used to classify new images into one of these categories. The classification phase involves using the trained model to classify 396 new images with different tree cover levels.
