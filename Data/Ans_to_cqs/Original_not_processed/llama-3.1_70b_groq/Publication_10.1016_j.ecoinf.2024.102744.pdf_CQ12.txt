Answer:::
The pipeline uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The text mentions the use of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which are typical components of a CNN. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a Global Average Pooling layer, which is also commonly used in CNNs. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the provided context.
