Answer: The data was split into three exclusive groups: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This split was applied to the four subsets from the two benchmark datasets: BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*).
