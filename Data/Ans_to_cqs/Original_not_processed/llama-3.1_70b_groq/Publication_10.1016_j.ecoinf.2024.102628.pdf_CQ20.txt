Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text only mentions the use of the fast.ai framework and the ResNet-34 architecture, but it does not provide information about the underlying hardware. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
