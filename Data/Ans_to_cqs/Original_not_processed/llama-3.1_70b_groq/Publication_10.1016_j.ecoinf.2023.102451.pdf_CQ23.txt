Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the performance of the model on the test set demonstrates how well the model can generalize. This suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate test set, which is a common practice to assess the generalizability of a model.

Additionally, the text mentions that the model was compared to other state-of-the-art models on the validation set and test set of the considered dataset EMDS-6. This implies that the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, which is a common practice to evaluate the performance of a model.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the diversity of the dataset. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model beyond the use of a separate test set.
