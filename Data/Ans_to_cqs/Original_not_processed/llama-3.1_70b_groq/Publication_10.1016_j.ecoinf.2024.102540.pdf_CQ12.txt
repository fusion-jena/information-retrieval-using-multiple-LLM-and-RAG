Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the YOLOv5 family of models, which is a type of CNN. The YOLOv5 models are used for object detection tasks, and in this case, they are used to detect alates on sorghum leaves. The YOLOv5 models are built on the PyTorch machine learning framework and come in different versions, including YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x, each with varying complexity and model sizes.
