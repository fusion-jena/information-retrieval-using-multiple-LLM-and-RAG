Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the model parameter tuning, map production, and post-classification refinement.

However, it does mention that "post-classification refinement was undertaken to improve the classification for certain classes and areas." This suggests that some form of post-processing was performed, but the specific steps involved are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of additional training data to improve the classification for certain classes and areas, which was obtained through aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits. This implies that some form of evaluation or assessment was performed, but the specific metrics or methods used are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
