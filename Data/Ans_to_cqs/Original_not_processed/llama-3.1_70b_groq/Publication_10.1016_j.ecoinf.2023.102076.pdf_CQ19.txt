Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a pre-trained language model, but it does not specify the framework used to implement or fine-tune BERT. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular frameworks that can be used to work with BERT, but the context does not provide enough information to determine which one was used in this case.
