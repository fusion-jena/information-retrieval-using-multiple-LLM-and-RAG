Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context only provides information about the architecture and hyperparameters of the models, but does not mention the underlying framework used to implement them. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
