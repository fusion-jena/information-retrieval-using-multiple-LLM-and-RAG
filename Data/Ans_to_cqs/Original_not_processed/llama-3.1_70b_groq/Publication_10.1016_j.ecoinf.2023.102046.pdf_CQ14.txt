Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that a hyperparameter search was performed to identify the right level of regularization for the classification and regression models. The text also mentions that the hyperparameter values were explored in a specific range, and the resulting accuracy of the models is shown in Figures C.1 and C.2. This suggests that some form of systematic search or sweep was used to optimize the hyperparameters, but the exact method is not specified.
