Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and techniques such as dropout and ADAM optimization, but it does not specify the framework used to implement these techniques. Therefore, I do not know which framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to build the deep learning model.
