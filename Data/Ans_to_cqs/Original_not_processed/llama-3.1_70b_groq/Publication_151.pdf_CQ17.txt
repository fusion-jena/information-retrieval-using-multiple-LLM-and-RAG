The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout) are based on the idea that that the model should be able to learn from the data and avoid overfitting. This is achieved through the use of regularization techniques such as the model's parameters of) and the model's ability to generalize from the data (e.g., dropout).
