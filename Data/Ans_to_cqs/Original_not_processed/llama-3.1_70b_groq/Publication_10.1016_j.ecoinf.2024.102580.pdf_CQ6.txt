Answer:

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Reducing the resolution of the images in the ground-truth dataset. Specifically, the resolution was reduced to 1000 Ã— 1333.
2. Normalizing the three color channels of the images by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations per channel. The color channel means and standard deviations were based on the ImageNet dataset used in the training of the (pre-trained) RestNet-50. The specific mean values used were [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], and the standard deviations were [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

These preprocessing steps were applied to the images in the ground-truth dataset before training the deep learning models, including the DETR model for object detection and the U-Net model for semantic segmentation.
