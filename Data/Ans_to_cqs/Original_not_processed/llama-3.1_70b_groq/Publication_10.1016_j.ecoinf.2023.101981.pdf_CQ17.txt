Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be discussing the detection of ungulate vocalizations using machine learning algorithms, but it does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
