Answer: 
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy. The study uses 5-fold cross-validation to divide the CLO-43SD dataset into 5 folds and reports the results as a box-plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. The mean accuracies are indicated by the red squares in Figure 1. However, it does not mention the use of precision, recall, or other metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
