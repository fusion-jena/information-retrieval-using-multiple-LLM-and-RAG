Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the framework used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a GPU-enabled runtime environment provided by Google Colab Pro, which supports popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, but it does not specify which one is used. Additionally, it mentions the use of a NVIDIA TESLA T4 graphic card, which is compatible with both TensorFlow and PyTorch, but again, it does not provide a clear answer.

However, it does mention the use of an ADAM optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning, and it is available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. But without more information, it is impossible to determine which framework is used.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine which framework is used to build the deep learning model.
