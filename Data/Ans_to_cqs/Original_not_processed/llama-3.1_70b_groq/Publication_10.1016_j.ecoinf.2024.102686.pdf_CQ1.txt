Answer: The provided context does not specifically mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information on the data sources used for the study.

According to Table 1, the data sources include:

* Open Spatial Demographic Data and Research (https://www.worldpop.org) for population density and economic density
* Resource and Environment Science and Data Center (http://www.resdc.cn) for geographic conditions, vegetation conditions, and other data
* National Meteorological Science Data Center (http://data.cma.cn) for climatic conditions
* Harmonized World Soil Database (https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub) for soil type data
* Geospatial Data Cloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/) for NDVI data

These data sources appear to be publicly available datasets, but the context does not provide information on whether surveys or sensors were used to collect the data. Therefore, I do not know the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
