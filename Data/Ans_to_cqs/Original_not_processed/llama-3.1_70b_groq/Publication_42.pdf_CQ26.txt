Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different CNN architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization techniques used for training the models. It does mention the need for more training data when using large deep learning networks to avoid overfitting, but it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. But this is not directly related to addressing data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
