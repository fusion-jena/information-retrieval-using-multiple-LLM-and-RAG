Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for bird species monitoring and image recognition, but it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning pipeline, including regularization methods.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of the BirdNET-Analyzer deep learning model, which is a pre-trained model. The original paper on BirdNET (Kahl et al., 2021) might provide more information on the architecture and training of the model, including any regularization methods used. Similarly, the paper on deep residual learning for image recognition (He et al., 2016) might provide insights into the regularization methods used in that specific context.

Without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have access to the original papers or more detailed information on the deep learning pipeline, you might be able to find the answer to your question.
