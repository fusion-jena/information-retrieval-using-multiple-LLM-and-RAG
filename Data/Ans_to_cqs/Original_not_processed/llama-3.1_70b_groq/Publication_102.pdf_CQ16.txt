Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context only discusses the performance comparison of different models on the test data set and the loss function used (Root Mean Square Error, RMSE). It also provides a training loss curve for Model-1 and Model-2, but it does not specify how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine convergence.

However, it is common in deep learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or a maximum number of epochs to determine when training is complete. But without more information, it is impossible to know for sure what criteria were used in this specific case.
