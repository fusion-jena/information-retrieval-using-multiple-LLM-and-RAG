Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that the species assemblage predictor is trained using a deep neural network with a cross-entropy loss function, but it does not specify the architecture of the neural network. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
