Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily discusses the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation, the application of a window with a specific size to obtain meaningful outputs, and the assessment of agreement strength between manual tracing and automated measurement methods. It does not provide information on the model's generalizability or the techniques used to ensure it.
