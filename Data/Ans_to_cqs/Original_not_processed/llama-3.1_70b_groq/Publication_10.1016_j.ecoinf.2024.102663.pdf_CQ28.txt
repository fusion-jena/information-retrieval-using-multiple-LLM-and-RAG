Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques for fish species detection and classification, and mentions the potential use of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, as well as modifying the architecture of deep learning models like YOLO. However, it does not provide information on the deployment platform.
