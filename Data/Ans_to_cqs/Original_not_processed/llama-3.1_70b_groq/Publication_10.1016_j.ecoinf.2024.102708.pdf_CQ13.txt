Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer. It only mentions the architectures of the models used, including YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN (FR-CNN), YOLOv5 small, YOLOv5 medium, and TPH-YOLOv5, but does not provide details on the hyperparameters used for training these models.
