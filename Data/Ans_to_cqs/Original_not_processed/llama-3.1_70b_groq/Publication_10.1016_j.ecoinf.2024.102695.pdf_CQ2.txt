Answer: 
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the input data is multivariate time series data, which is likely stored in a format such as CSV or a similar tabular format. The text mentions "time series data" and "variables" in the dataset, which suggests that the data is numerical and tabular in nature. There is no indication of image, audio, or video data being used in the pipeline.
