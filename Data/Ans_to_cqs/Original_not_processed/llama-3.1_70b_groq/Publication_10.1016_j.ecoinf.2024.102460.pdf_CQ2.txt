Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it appears that the study is focused on land use and land cover changes, and the data sources mentioned include raster maps and time series data. 

It can be inferred that the data formats used might include raster data (e.g., GeoTIFF) and possibly CSV files for time series data. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context, and other data formats such as images, audio, or video are not mentioned at all. Therefore, the answer is not definitive, and more information would be needed to provide a clear answer.
