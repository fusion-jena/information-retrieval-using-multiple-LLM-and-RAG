Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. It only mentions that the model was retrained using hand-annotated data for 40 epochs on a Tesla K80 GPU, but it does not provide information about the framework used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
