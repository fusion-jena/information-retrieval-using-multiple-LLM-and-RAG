Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of the UNet architecture called Res_AUNet. This is evident from the text, which mentions the "UNet convolutional neural network" and the integration of the Convolutional Block Attention Module into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the network. The text also mentions the use of convolutional blocks and residual structures, which are typical components of CNNs.
