Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context appears to be related to ecological modeling, specifically ensemble habitat selection modeling, and discusses the selection of background points for model construction. It does not mention deep learning or any related concepts. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide an answer to this query.
