Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, feature selection, and classification models, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
