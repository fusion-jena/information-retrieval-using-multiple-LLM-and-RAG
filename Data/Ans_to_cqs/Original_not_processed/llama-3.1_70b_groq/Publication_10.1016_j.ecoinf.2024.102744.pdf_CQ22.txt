Answer:

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are:

1. Miss Rate (MR)
2. False Alarm Rate (FAR)
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F1-score

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the model in detecting pollen-bearing bees. The F1-score is used to gauge the balance between Precision and Recall. The formulas for calculating these metrics are:

* Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
* Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
* F1-score = 2 \* (Precision \* Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
* MR = FN / (FN + TP)
* FAR = FP / (FP + TP)

Where TP, TN, FP, and FN stand for True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative respectively.
