Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance, the threshold used for classification, and the creation of a bias grid, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
