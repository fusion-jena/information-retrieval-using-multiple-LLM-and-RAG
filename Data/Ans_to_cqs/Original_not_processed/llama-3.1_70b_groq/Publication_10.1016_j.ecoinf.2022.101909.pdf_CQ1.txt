Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the development of a method for passive monitoring of bird activity, diversity, and acoustic phenology using advanced techniques in dataset construction, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, transfer learning, and fine-tuning techniques, but does not provide information on the data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection method might involve recording audio data, as the context mentions the use of spectrograms and acoustic activity. Additionally, the mention of a "scarcely studied ecoregion" suggests that the data might be collected through field recordings or sensors. Nevertheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
