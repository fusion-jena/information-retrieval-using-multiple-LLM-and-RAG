Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the use of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, for assessing aboveground biomass and ecological classification of grasslands using remote sensing data. It discusses the use of QGIS software, SAGA software, and the tuning of hyperparameters for the Random Forest algorithm, but does not mention techniques for addressing data bias.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. If you have any further context or clarification, I would be happy to try and assist you further.
