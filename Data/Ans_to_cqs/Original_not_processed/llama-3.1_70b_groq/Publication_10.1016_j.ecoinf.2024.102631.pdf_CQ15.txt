Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the network, loss functions, and evaluation metrics, but does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques used in this pipeline.
