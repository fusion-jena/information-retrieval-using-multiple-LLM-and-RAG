The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The dataset consists of 426,876 images, which were centre cropped to an equally sized rectangle and used for training, validation, and testing. The images were also augmented in various ways, such as flipping, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue, to gain a more robust and better generalizing classifier.
