Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text mentions that the model was selected based on the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set, but it does not specify which metrics were used to measure performance.

However, it is common in deep learning applications to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP) to evaluate model performance. But without further information, it is impossible to determine which specific metrics were used in this case.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the dataset is "substantially imbalanced", which suggests that the model may have been evaluated using metrics that are robust to class imbalance, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. However, this is purely speculative, and without further information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
