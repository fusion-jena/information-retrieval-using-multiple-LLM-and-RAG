Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecological niche modeling, species distribution, and climate change, with references to various research articles and studies. There is no mention of deep learning or randomness in the context, so I am unable to provide a relevant answer to the query.
