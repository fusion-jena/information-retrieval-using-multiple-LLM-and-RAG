Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be related to a research study on fire risk mapping using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. The text discusses the methodology, data categorization, and validation of fire risk maps, but it does not mention anything about training or validation loss plateau. Therefore, I couldn't find any relevant information to answer the query.
