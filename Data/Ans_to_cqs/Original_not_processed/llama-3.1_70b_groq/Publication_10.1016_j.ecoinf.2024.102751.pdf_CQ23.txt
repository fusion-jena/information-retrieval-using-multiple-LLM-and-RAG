Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the evaluation of the predictive model's performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2, as well as the interpretation of the results. It also mentions the use of PlanetScope satellite imagery and the analysis of measured data obtained in different land cover classes. However, it does not provide information on the methods used to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
