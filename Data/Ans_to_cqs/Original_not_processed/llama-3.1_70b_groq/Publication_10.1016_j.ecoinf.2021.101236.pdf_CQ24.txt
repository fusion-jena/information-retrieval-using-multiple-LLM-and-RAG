Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The text primarily focuses on the introduction of the BirdNET algorithm, its application in avian diversity monitoring, and the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spectrogram data for bird species classification.

However, it is mentioned that the overall process "mostly followed current best practices in deep learning" as summarized in (Chollet, 2017). This suggests that the authors may have employed standard techniques to handle randomness, but the specific details are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I do not know the exact strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, and I cannot provide a more detailed answer based on the provided text.
