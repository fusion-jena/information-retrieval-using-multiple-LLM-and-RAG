Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses the limitations of a Random Forest (RF) model in predicting low-value LAI samples and mentions the use of pixel quality control metrics to eliminate cloud-contaminated and poor-quality pixels. It also references a study by Jamali et al. (2023) that used deep neural networks to estimate leaf parameters, but it does not provide information on the deployment process of the model.
