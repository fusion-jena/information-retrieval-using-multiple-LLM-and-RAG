Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques related to image processing and analysis, such as semantic segmentation (Liu et al., 2017) and instance segmentation is not explicitly mentioned but it is related to semantic segmentation.

It also mentions the use of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for multi-temporal land cover classification (Rußwurm & Körner, 2017), but it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of deep learning for image classification (Zhao & Du, 2016) and object localization (Zhou et al., 2016), but it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
