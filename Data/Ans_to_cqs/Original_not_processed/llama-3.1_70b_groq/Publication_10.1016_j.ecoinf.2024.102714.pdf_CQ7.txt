Answer: The criteria used to split the data for the machine learning (ML) model training is to split the polygons rather than pixels, with approximately 30% of pixels for each Vegetation Type (VT) reserved for independent model validation. This approach is taken to minimize the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies.
