Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the training process of a generative model and an MLP for classification tasks, but it does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
