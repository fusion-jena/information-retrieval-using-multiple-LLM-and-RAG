Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing a study on coral reef communities, and it includes references to various publications and authors. However, there is no mention of a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
