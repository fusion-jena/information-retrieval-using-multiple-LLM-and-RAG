Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil using machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest. It discusses the configuration of parameters for the RF training, such as the number of random regression trees, division variables, and minimum node size. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
