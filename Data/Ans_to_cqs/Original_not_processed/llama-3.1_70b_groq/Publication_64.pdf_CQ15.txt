Answer:::
The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is Adam. According to the provided context, "We train the model for 100 epochs on a GTX 1080 for 6 days using Adam as learning rule." This indicates that the Adam optimization algorithm is used to update the model's weights during training.
