Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to disease vector abundance prediction and mentions various research papers and techniques, but it does not provide information about the datasets used.

However, it does mention that the model selection procedure involves training models on a small subset of the training data (data partition At) and then selecting the best-performing model to train on the full training data (data partition Bt). It also mentions that the models are trained on time series data, but it does not provide information about the specific datasets used.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
