Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to a study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
