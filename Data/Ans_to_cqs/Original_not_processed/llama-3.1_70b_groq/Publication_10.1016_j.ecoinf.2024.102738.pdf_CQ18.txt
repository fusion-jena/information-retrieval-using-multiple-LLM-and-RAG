Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context appears to be related to a study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification, and it discusses the dataset, spectral indices, and classification methodology, but it does not provide information on the model training process or performance monitoring. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
