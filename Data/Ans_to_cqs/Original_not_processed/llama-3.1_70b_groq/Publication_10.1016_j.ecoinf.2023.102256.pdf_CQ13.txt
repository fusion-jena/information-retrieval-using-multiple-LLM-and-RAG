Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text only describes the architecture of the baseline model and the approach to incorporate additional information into the model, but it does not provide details on the training process or hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
