Answer:::
Data augmentation is used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. According to the provided context, data augmentation techniques applied include rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image. These techniques aim to enhance sample variation and reduce data bias. However, other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.
