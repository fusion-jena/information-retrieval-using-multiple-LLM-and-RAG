Answer: According to the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is based on the validation loss. Specifically, the model is set to stop training if the validation loss does not improve within 10 epochs, which is known as early stopping. This means that if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, the training process is stopped.
