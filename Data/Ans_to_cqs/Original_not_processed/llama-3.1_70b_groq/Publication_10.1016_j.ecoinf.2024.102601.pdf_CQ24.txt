Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization techniques using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for random forests, a type of machine learning algorithm.

However, it does mention that RandomizedSearchCV performs a probabilistic search over the predefined hyperparameter space, which involves generating a sample of parameter settings based on specified distributions. This approach allows for efficient navigation of vast hyperparameter spaces, especially when there is uncertainty regarding the optimal values.

While this information is related to handling randomness in hyperparameter optimization, it does not directly address the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or the use of random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a more specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
