Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using an automated expectation-maximization process, which is based on a random walk with 300 steps for minimizing the MDL (Minimum Description Length) score. This process is used to identify the optimal number of cluster states and the data contained in each cluster. The final ten steps of the random walk are used to check for stability, with a stable outcome having the same number of clusters for all ten final steps. 

There is no mention of grid search or random search being used for hyperparameter optimization in the provided context. The expectation-maximization process is the primary method used for optimizing the model's hyperparameters.
