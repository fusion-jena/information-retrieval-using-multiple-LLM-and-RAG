Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network, the loss function, and the experimental setting.

However, it does mention the use of batch normalization, which can help with regularization to some extent. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) as the non-linear operation, but it does not provide information on other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what other regularization methods, if any, are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
