Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as one of the well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the study proposed a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in China's Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This dataset was used to evaluate the performance of 8 deep learning algorithms for bird object detection.
