Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for urban ecoacoustic assessment and the development of a machine learning pipeline, but it does not provide details on the evaluation metrics used.

However, it is mentioned that the CNN classifier's parameters were optimized to improve classification performance during training, suggesting that some form of evaluation metric was used to assess the model's performance. Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, but without further information, it is unclear which specific metrics were used in this case.
