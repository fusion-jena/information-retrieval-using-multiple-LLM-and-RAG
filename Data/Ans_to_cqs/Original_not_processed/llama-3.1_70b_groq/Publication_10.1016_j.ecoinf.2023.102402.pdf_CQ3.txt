I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to ecological and biological research, including papers on bioclimatic modeling, citizen science, and species occurrence data. There is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques.
