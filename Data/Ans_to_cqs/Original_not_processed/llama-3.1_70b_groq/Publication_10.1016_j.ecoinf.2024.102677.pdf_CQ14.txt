Answer: The text does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that "After parameter tuning, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were set to 0.0001, 8, and 30, respectively." This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific method used (e.g., grid search, random search) is not specified.
