Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the preprocessing and training of the data, specifically the creation of spectrograms and metadata files, but does not provide information on how the raw bird song data was collected. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
