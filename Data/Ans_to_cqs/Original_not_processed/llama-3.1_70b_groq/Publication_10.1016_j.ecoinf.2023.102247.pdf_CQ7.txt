Answer: The context does not specifically mention deep learning models, but it does describe the approach used for ensemble modeling. According to the text, the data was split into training and testing sets using cross-validation, where 70% of the dataset was used as training data to build the models and the remaining 30% was used as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. There is no mention of a separate validation set.
