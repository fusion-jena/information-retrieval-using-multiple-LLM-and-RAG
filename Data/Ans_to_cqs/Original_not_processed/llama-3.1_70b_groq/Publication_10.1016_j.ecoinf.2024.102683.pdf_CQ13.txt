Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context primarily focuses on the attention mechanism, data augmentation techniques, and the proposed SCAM-Herb model, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the model. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
