Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition, disease detection, and medicinal plant classification. It discusses various studies and their approaches, including the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), VGG-16, ResNet-50, and other architectures. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques used in these studies.

Therefore, I do not know the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query.
