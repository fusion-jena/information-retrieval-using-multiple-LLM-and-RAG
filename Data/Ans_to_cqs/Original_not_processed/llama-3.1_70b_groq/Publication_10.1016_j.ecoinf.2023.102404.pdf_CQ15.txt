Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context only discusses the hyperparameter tuning of a machine learning model using a grid search method, where the model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation techniques and the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the evaluation metric. The optimization of hyperparameters is done through an exhaustive search of possible combinations of values for the 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed' parameters. However, the context does not provide information on the optimization techniques used for training the model, such as the optimizer algorithm or learning rate schedule.
