Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on downscaling climate data, species distribution models, and comparing the performance of different algorithms. 

However, it does mention the use of deep learning in the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). But it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps used in this paper.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
