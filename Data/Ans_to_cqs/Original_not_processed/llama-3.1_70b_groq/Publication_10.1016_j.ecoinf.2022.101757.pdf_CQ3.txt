Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the COCO dataset, which is used to train the DeeplabV3+ model, has a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. This suggests that the COCO dataset uses some form of object annotation, but the specific technique is not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions that the study uses semantic segmentation, which is a type of pixel-wise classification, to locate and delineate artificial and natural objects in photos. This implies that the data annotation technique used is likely some form of pixel-level annotation, but the exact technique is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the detail of the skyline in the semantic segmentation results. CRF is a technique used to refine the output of a neural network, but it is not a data annotation technique per se.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the data annotation used in the study, it does not explicitly mention the specific techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the exact data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
