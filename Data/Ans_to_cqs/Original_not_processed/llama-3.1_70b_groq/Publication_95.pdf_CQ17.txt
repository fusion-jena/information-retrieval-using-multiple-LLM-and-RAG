Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention that the training set was balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species". This can be seen as a form of regularization to prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model is not biased towards the majority class.

Additionally, the context mentions a data augmentation procedure that was applied to the images during training, which includes randomly flipping the image horizontally, scaling the contrast of each image channel, and randomly cropping the image. Data augmentation can also be seen as a form of regularization, as it helps to prevent overfitting by increasing the diversity of the training data and making the model more robust to different transformations.

However, it is not possible to determine if other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization were used, as this information is not provided in the context.
