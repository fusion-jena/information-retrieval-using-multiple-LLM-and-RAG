Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. It discusses model complexity, feature selection, and model explainability, but it does not provide information on how a trained model was deployed. The context appears to be focused on the development and evaluation of data-driven models, rather than their deployment.
