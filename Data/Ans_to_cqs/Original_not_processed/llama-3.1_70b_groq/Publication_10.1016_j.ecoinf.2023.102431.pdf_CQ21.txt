Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the development and evaluation of discriminant models for species and sex discrimination using track data from fishers and martens.

The context does mention the evaluation of the models, including the calculation of classification success rates, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps used. For example, it mentions that the full species discrimination model had a near-perfect classification success rate, misclassifying only 1 out of 532 tracks, and that a univariable model consisting of variable V16 had a species classification success rate of over 99%. However, it does not provide information on how these metrics were calculated or if any additional postprocessing steps were performed.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed answer to the query.
