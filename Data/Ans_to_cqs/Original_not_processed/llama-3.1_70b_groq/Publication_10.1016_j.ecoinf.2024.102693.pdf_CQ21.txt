Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the hyperparameters for different models, classification performance on the IP102 dataset, and the architecture of transformer-like and MLP-like models. Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
