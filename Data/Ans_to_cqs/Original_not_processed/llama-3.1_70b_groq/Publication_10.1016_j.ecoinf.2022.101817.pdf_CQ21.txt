Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of performance metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. 

The text mentions that the "validation performance of CNN Model 4 with respect to each of the six environmental conditions is shown in the confusion matrix of Fig. 7 (b)". This suggests that a confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.

Additionally, the text provides a table showing the predicted environmental condition classes along with their corresponding probabilities. This table also includes performance metrics such as the percentage of correct classifications for each environmental condition. For example, it is mentioned that the model correctly classified 79.12% of the samples as "Turbidity".

There is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if saliency maps are generated as part of the postprocessing steps.

Overall, the postprocessing steps that can be confirmed based on the provided context include the calculation of performance metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.
