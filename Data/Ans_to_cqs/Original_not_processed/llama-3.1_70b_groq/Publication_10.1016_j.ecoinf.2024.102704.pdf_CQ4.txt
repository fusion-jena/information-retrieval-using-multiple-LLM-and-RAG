Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily focuses on optimizing memory access, reducing the number of layers and parameters in the network model, and incorporating techniques like DWConv and SimAM attention mechanism to improve model performance and efficiency.

However, it does mention that the authors utilized various models (LigObNet, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) to train across four scales (n, s, m, and l) to delve deeper into the underlying causes of enhancing model lightweight and inference speed. But it does not provide information on the specific data augmentation techniques used in these models.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
