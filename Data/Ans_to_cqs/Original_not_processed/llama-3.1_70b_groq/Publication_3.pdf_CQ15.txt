Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. It discusses the use of transfer learning and the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
