Answer: The purpose of the Machine Learning (ML) model, specifically the Random Forest (RF) technique, is classification. The model is used to assess Aboveground Biomass and ecological classification of semi-natural grasslands. The RF technique is employed to classify grassland species into two main clusters, which enables sustainable grassland management. The model utilizes ground data points and remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to generate accurate and dynamic information on grassland attributes. The classification results are used to estimate forage quantity and quality of semi-natural grasslands, which is essential for sustainable ecosystem management and conservation.
