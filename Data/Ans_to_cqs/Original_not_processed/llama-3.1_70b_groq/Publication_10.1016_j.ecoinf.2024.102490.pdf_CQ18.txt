Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is to use 80% of the data as the training set and the remaining 20% as the evaluation set. This procedure allows for thoroughly assessing the precision of the models. Additionally, two metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models: the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS).
