Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to a research paper or academic publication, listing authors and their contributions to the paper, as well as references to other publications. There is no mention of deep learning, data annotation, or related topics. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
