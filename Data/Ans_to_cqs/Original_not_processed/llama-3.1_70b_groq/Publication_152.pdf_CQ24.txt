Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to improve the F1 score of the model. Data augmentation can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's robustness to random variations in the data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a custom loss function, which may help improve the model's performance and reduce the impact of randomness in the training process. However, it does not provide specific details on how randomness is handled in the pipeline.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a specific deep learning architecture, U-Net, and a specific dataset, but it does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the training process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query. However, it can be inferred that data augmentation and custom loss functions may be used to improve the model's performance and reduce the impact of randomness in the training process.
