Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline uses the following data formats:

* Image: jpeg format for trap image files
* CSV: for bounding box information, one line per box, containing coordinates (in pixels) and a species label

Additionally, the pipeline outputs binary pickle files containing the classification model (ResNet152). 

It is also mentioned that the output directory is populated with subdirectories containing insect images of the relevant species, extracted from the trap images, based on the bounding box coordinates and annotation. However, the format of these output images is not explicitly mentioned.
