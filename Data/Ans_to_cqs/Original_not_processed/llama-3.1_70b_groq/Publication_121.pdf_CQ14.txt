Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions the optimizer used for each model (Adam optimizer for MobileNetV2 and Gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.5 and momentum of 0.9 for MobileNetV3), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. It does not mention whether grid search, random search, or any other method is used to optimize the hyperparameters.
