Answer:::

The provided context mentions stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it states that "the trained neural network generalizes well to novel input data. Model weights are adjusted to minimize error on each subsequent run using an algorithm called stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation (LeCun et al., 1989; Rumelhart et al., 1995)."

However, it does not mention Adam as an optimization technique in the provided context. Adam is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning, but it is not mentioned in the given text.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline.
