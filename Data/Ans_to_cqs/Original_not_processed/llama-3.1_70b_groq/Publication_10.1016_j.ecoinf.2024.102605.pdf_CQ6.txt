Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be a collection of research paper references and snippets related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and machine learning, but it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

However, based on general knowledge, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include:

* Normalization: scaling numeric data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: transforming data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve model stability and convergence.
* Cleaning: handling missing or erroneous data, such as removing or imputing missing values, and removing outliers or noisy data.

It's worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps required may vary depending on the type of data, the model architecture, and the problem being solved. Without more information or context, it's difficult to provide a more detailed answer.
