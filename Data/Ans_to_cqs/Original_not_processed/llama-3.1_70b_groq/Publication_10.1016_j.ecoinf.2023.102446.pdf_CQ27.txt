Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be related to data collection and processing, specifically in the context of a pine-dominated ecosystem, and discusses the use of a process network approach called TPINet. It does not provide any information about deep learning models or their deployment.
