Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing images, specifically Sentinel-2 images, which are used for spectral modeling and classification. The images are processed and analyzed using various software, including QGIS, SAGA, and SNAP-ESA.

The context also mentions the use of ground data points for machine learning training, but it does not specify the format of these data points. However, it is likely that the data points are in a format such as CSV or a similar tabular format.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data formats used in the pipeline appear to be primarily image data (specifically, remote sensing images) and possibly tabular data (such as CSV) for the ground data points. However, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without more information about the specific pipeline being referred to.
