Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is ImageNet. This is mentioned in the context as the dataset on which the pre-trained networks were trained. Specifically, it is mentioned that the classification networks were pre-trained on ImageNet, and that the input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling between 0 and 1.
