Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The context appears to be related to the development and testing of the model, including the use of different datasets, models (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, VGG16), and techniques (dynamic convolutional decomposition), but it does not provide information about the deployment platform.
