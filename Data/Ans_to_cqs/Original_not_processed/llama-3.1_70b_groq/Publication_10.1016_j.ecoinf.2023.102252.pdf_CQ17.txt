Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystems, and biodiversity maintenance, with equations and parameters describing ecological targets and conditions. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
