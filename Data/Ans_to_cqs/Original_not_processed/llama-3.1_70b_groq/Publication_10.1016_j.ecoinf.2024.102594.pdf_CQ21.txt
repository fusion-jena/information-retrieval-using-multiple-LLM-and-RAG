Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the use of the ReduceLROnPlateau callback, image preprocessing, and data augmentation techniques. It also mentions the evaluation metrics, such as overall accuracy (OA) and kappa, but does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps.

However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as OA and kappa, and the results are visualized using segmentation results and classification results (Fig. 4). Additionally, the context mentions the calculation of reduction rates of OA and kappa in the UAV image models (Table 5).

But, specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Confusion matrix, and other metrics calculation are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the exact postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
