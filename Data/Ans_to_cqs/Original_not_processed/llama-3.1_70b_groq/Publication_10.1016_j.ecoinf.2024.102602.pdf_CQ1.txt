Answer:

According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for monitoring invasive alien plants include:

1. Citizen science platforms: Data can be collected from citizen science platforms, where the public contributes information about invasive alien plants.
2. Social media platforms: Data can also be collected from social media platforms, where users share information and images about invasive alien plants.
3. API (Application Programming Interface): Data can be collected through APIs, which allow for the automated collection of data from social media and citizen science platforms.
4. Web scraping: Data can also be collected through web scraping methods, although not all platforms allow this due to terms and conditions of use.

These methods enable the collection of big digital data, including images, which can then be used to train deep learning models for the detection and classification of invasive alien plants.
