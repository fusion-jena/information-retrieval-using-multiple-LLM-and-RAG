Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context only mentions that the official, MS-COCO pre-trained version of the architecture was further trained using the WCS dataset and its recommended data split, resulting in a mean average precision mAP50 score of 0.75. However, it does not provide information on the stopping criteria used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
