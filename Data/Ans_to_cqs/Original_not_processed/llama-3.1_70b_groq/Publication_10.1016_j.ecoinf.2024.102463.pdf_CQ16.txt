Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does describe a model optimization process that involves successive halving and partial training to eliminate underperforming configurations. The process is repeated until only one configuration remains, which is then considered the best configuration found.

The context also mentions the use of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) score as metrics for the training phase, but it does not specify how these metrics are used to determine the completion of training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
