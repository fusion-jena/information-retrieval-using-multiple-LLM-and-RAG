Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), including convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, as well as the functionality of these layers. It does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
