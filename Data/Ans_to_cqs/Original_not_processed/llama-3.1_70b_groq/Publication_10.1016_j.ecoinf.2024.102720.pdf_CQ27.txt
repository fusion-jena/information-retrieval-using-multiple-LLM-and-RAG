Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to environmental sustainability, ecological informatics, and land use management. There is no mention of deep learning model deployment or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query as it is not related to the provided context.
