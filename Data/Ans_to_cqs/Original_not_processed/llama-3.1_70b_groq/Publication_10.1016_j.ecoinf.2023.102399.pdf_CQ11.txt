Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research article or a paper discussing a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network, but it does not provide information on where the data or the pipeline is stored. The references provided are to other research articles and journals, but there is no mention of a data repository link.
