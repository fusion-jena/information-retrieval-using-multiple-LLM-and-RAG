Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses various topics such as the BirdVox-DCASE-10 h dataset, transductive few-shot learning, and meta-learning methods, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
