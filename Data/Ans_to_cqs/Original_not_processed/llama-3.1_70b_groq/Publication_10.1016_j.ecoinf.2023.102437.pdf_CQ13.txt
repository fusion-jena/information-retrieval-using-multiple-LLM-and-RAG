Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the paper "Enhancing land cover/land use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" discusses the optimization of hyperparameters for a deep neural network, but it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used.

However, it does mention that the paper compares the performance of different hyperparameter optimization approaches for a deep neural network, but it does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
