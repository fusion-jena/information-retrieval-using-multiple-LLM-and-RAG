Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the methodology and techniques used for landslide susceptibility mapping, including the use of various machine learning models and ensemble techniques. It does not provide information on the computational resources or hardware used for training the models. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question.
