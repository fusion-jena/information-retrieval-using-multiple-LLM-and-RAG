Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to environmental science and sustainability. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. The context does not provide any information about a specific code repository or where it might be hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this question based on the provided context.
