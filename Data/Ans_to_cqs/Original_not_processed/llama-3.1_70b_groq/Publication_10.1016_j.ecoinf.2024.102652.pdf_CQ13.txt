Answer:

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

* Batch size: 32, chosen to not exceed the memory limit and to make full use of computer resources.
* Optimizer: Adam processing.
* Learning rate: varies with group based on the cosine function's law, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0.
* Number of epochs: 100, with an early stopping function to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs.
* Loss function: cross-entropy loss function.

These hyperparameters were used to train the network, which was designed to fit into the network with normalized and standardized data.
