Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, the performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity, and the creation of recognizers for bird songs using different training sets. However, it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

The context does mention the work of Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), which analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks, but it does not provide details on the regularization methods used in their study. Similarly, the context mentions the use of Arbimon for manual validation of bird songs, but it does not provide information on the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
