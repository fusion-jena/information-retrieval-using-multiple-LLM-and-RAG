Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context mentions that Halgamuge et al. (2020) used deep learning technology to estimate the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Similarly, the other references mentioned in the context, such as Dowdy (2020), Sevinc et al. (2020), and Smigaj et al. (2015), do not provide information on the type of deep learning model used.

Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
