Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. It does provide information on the datasets used, such as the Google Search Image dataset and the Portuguese Flora dataset, but it does not specify how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it does mention that for the Google Search Image dataset, they selected the 3680 labels with more than 12 images in the training dataset and retrieved the 10 first images returned by the Google Image Search engine for each label. This suggests that the dataset was curated to ensure a minimum number of images per label, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training and testing.

Similarly, for the Portuguese Flora dataset, it mentions that they selected the 15K images belonging to one of the 1300 species which are also present in the training dataset, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training and testing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
