Answer:::

I don't know. The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and their application in estimating evapotranspiration (ETa) using various input features such as soil water content, weather, and satellite data. However, it does not provide information on data annotation techniques.
