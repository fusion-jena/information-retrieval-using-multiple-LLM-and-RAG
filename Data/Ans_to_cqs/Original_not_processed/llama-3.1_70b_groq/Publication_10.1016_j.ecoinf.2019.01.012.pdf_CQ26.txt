Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the architecture and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, but it does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the text mentions that the model was trained on a large dataset with nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class, which may suggest that the dataset is relatively balanced. Nevertheless, without further information, it is impossible to determine whether any techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
