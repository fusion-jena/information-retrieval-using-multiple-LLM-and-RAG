Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the development and training of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, including the selection of the number of neurons in the hidden layer, learning rate, and the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting. It does mention the calculation of the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data, but it does not provide information on any postprocessing steps that may have been performed after the model training.
