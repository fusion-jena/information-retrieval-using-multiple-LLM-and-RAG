Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context appears to be focused on the application of remote sensing and LiDAR data for forest mapping, biomass estimation, and ecological studies, but it does not provide information on the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
