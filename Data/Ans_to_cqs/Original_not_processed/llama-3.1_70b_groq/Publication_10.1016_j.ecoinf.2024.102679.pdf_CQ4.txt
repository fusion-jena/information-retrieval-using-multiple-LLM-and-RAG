Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context discusses the use of deep learning for wildlife conservation, aerial surveys, and image processing, but it does not provide details on the data augmentation techniques used. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
