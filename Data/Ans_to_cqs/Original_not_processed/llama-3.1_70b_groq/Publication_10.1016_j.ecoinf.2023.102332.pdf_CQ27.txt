Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the use of word embeddings, such as Word2vec, and pre-trained models like BERT, for natural language processing tasks, particularly in the context of cultural ecosystem service assessments and wildlife observations on Twitter. It does not provide information on model deployment, serialization, or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
