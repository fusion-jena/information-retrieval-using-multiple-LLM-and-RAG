Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the use of a confusion matrix to validate the performance of the machine learning model. 

The confusion matrix is used to calculate various metrics such as True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). These metrics are then used to calculate the sensitivity (TPR) of the model, which is the ratio of accurate predictions of bleached corals.

The context also mentions the use of different performance metrics, but it does not provide a detailed list of the postprocessing steps involved. It does not mention the use of saliency maps or other techniques to interpret the model's predictions.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed is the calculation of the confusion matrix and the associated metrics. Other postprocessing steps, such as the calculation of additional metrics or the use of saliency maps, are not mentioned.
