Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the classification network, including the use of Dropout, Global Average Pooling, and fully connected layers. It also discusses the evaluation metrics and comparison of different methods, including YOLOv5 and Faster RCNN.

However, it does mention the use of a novel module called C3 in YOLOv5, which is designed to enhance speed, and the adoption of the SiLU activation function in YOLOv5, which is different from YOLOv4's use of Mish. But it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used.

Therefore, I do not know the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
