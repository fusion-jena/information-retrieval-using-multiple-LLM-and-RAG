Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be focused on parameter estimation with Maximum Likelihood (ML) and regularization techniques, as well as ensemble methods like bagging and boosting (specifically XGBoost). It discusses the use of regularization to prevent over-fitting, the importance of ensemble size in boosting, and a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme to optimize the number of iterations in XGBoost. However, it does not provide information on deep learning model hyperparameters.
