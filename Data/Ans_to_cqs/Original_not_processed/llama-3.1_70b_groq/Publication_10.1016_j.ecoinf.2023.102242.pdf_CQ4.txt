Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. The context primarily discusses the challenges of processing high-resolution remote sensing data, the importance of representative and sufficient training samples, and the use of feature optimization tools to address these issues. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
