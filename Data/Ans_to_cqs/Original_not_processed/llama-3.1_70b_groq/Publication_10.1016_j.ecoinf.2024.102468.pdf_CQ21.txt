Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The text only discusses the training stage of the HMM model, where the parameters are estimated, and the testing stage, where the model is evaluated. It also provides some insights into the comparison of the WT-HMM model's performance using varying dataset sizes. However, it does not provide any information about the postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
