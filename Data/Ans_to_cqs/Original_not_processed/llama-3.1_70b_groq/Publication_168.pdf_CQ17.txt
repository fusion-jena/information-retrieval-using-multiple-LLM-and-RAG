Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that Y. Chen et al. [6] designed a new CNN model with regularization based on the 3-D convolutional to solve the HSI classification task. Unfortunately, the specific regularization method used is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I can only confirm that regularization is used in at least one of the mentioned deep learning models, but I do not know the specific methods used (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization).
