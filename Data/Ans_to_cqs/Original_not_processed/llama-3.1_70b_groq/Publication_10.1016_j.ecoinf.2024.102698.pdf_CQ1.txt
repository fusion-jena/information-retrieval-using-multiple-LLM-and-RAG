Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on synthetic data generation, ecological informatics, and coral reef research. It discusses various machine learning methods, including classical and deep learning techniques, but does not delve into data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the context assumes the availability of raw data, which is then used to generate synthetic data or train machine learning models. The context mentions the use of satellites (NOAA satellite and information service) and public datasets (e.g., Ecological Informatics), but it does not provide a comprehensive list of data collection methods.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, as the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
