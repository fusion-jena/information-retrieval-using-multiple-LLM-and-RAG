Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on a study that uses a data fusion algorithm and various machine learning models (e.g., RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) for classification tasks. It discusses feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) and the combination of base models to obtain prediction results.

However, it does not provide information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
