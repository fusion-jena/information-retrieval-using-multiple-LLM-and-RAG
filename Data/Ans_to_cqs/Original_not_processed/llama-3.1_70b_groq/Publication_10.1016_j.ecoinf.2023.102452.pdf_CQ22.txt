Answer:

The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention the use of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) metric to evaluate the performance of forecasting models.

According to Table 4, the NSE values are reported for different models, including GP, GP-ANN, MEE-GP, and MEE-GP-ANN, for both training and testing scenarios. The NSE values range from 0.03 to 0.77, indicating varying levels of model performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of statistical metrics such as Mean Error (MEE), Average (Ave), Maximum (Max), Minimum (Min), and Standard Deviation (St.dev) to evaluate the performance of the models.

However, it does not provide information on the use of precision and recall metrics, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Therefore, I do not know if precision and recall are used as evaluation metrics in this context.
