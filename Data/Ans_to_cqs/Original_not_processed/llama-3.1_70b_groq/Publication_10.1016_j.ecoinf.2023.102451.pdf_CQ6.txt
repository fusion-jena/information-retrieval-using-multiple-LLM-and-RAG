Answer: According to the provided context, some preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data augmentation and normalization. These steps are performed to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning. Therefore, the answer is limited to data augmentation and normalization.
