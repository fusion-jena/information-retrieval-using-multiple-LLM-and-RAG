Answer: 
The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the network was trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch. This suggests that the training was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than being based on a specific stopping criterion such as a validation loss plateau.
