Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

- Number of iterations: 4000
- Number of epochs: 200
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Batch size: 16
- Subdivisions: 64

These hyperparameters were used to train and validate the Yolo model, as shown in Table 1. However, the optimizer used in the model is not specified in the provided context.
