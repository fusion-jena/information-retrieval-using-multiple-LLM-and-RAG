Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the architecture of the model, including the use of residual networks, batch normalization, and layer normalization, as well as the layout of the encoder and decoder. However, it does not provide information on how the model's performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
