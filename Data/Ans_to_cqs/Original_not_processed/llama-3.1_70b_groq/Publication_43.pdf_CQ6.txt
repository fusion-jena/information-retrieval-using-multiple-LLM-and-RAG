Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the authors analyzed several pre-processing techniques to generate better and faster candidate regions for object detection. The techniques that improved the performance of the CNN detectors in this work were:

1. Eliminating the background using a threshold based on the high albedo (light color)

No other preprocessing steps are mentioned in the provided context. It does not mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning as preprocessing steps. It also mentions data-augmentation as a technique to overcome the limitation of a small labeled training-set, but it is not clear if data-augmentation is used as a preprocessing step in this specific work.
