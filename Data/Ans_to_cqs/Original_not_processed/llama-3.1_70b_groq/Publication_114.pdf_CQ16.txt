Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be focused on the classification accuracies of different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) and their performance on a specific task, but it does not provide information on the training process or the stopping criteria used.

However, it is common in deep learning to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, validation accuracy plateau, or a maximum number of epochs to determine when training is complete. These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is not trained for too long, which can lead to degradation in performance.

In the context of the provided text, it is mentioned that the accuracy of the models can become saturated and then degrade (degradation problem) in the training phase, but it does not provide information on how this issue is addressed or what criteria are used to stop training.
