Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention the specific location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It only discusses the details of the pipeline and the dataset used for goat vocalization detection. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can suggest that the data repository might be mentioned in the references or citations provided in the text, but it is not explicitly stated. If you need to find the data repository, you might need to look for additional information or contact the authors of the text.

Answer: I don't know.
