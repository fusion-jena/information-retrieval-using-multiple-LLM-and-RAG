Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning to overcome the challenge of limited training samples, which can be related to data bias.

The context mentions that the dataset was divided into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 75:25, but it does not provide information on how the data was split or if any techniques were used to address data bias.

Some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
