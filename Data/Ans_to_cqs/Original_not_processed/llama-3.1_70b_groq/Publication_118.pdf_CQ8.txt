Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the network architecture used was a heavily modified version of that used in “Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch” by GitHub user “eelxpeng” (eelxpeng, 2018). This suggests that the original code may be available on GitHub, but the modified version used in this research is not explicitly mentioned as being available on any specific platform.
