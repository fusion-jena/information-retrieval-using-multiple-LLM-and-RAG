Answer:::

The purpose of the model is not explicitly stated as a deep learning model, but rather as a machine-learning model and specifically a MaxEnt-based ecological niche model. The purpose of this model is to predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in a specific basin under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. 

The model uses species occurrence and prevalence data to produce spatial species distributions over the years for 180 species. These distributions are then binarised through thresholding, and finally, species richness is obtained through model overlapping and summing. 

The model's output is used to assess the impact of climate change on biodiversity, specifically on bird and insect species, and to identify areas where habitat suitability has improved or deteriorated. The model's purpose is to provide insights into the potential effects of climate change on the basin's biodiversity, which can inform conservation strategies and policy decisions.
