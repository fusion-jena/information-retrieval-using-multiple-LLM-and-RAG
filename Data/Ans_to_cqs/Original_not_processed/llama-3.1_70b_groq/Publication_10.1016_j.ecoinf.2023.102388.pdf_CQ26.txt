Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of generalization in deep learning, overfitting, and the importance of avoiding it. It also discusses the use of certain techniques such as batch-norm, dropout, and weight decay to reduce overfitting, but it does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias.

However, it does mention the importance of having a diverse dataset, as it mentions the impact of having a limited size target dataset on the attack dataset. But it does not provide specific techniques for achieving this diversity.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query. The techniques mentioned in the query (Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, Diverse data collection) are not mentioned in the provided context.
