Answer: 

The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are primarily audio-based. Specifically, the pipeline uses audio representations such as spectrograms or mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) which can be represented as single-channel images. Additionally, the pipeline also operates directly on 1-D waveforms. There is no mention of video or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
