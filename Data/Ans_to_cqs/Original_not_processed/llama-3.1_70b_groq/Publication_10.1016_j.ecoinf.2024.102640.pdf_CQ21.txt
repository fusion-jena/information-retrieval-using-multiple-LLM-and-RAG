Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the GreenCam system, its functionality, and the user study conducted to evaluate its usability. It also provides details about the deep learning models used, including SegFormer and EPDNet, but does not elaborate on the postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this query.
