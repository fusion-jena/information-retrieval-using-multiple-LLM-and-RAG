Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a related concept, "class imbalance," in the reference "Johnson, J.M., Khoshgoftaar, T.M., 2019. Survey on deep learning with class imbalance." This suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of class imbalance, which is a type of data bias.

That being said, the context does not provide specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention the use of a "multi-branch CNN" to incorporate additional information into a deep learning classifier, which could potentially be used to address data bias.

In general, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, without more specific information from the context, it is unclear which techniques are being used in this particular case.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
