Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or where it is available. The context appears to be a collection of academic papers and research articles related to remote sensing, water quality, and machine learning, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
