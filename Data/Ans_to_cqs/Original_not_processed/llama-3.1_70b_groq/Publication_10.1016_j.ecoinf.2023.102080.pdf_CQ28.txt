Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It appears to be discussing a research paper on ecological informatics, specifically a species distribution modeling procedure using the covsel R package. The context mentions the use of a 10-core central processing unit strategy with AMD EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster, but this is related to running analyses, not deploying a deep learning model.
