Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using an instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. This suggests that the training was done on a cloud-based virtual machine with multiple virtual CPUs and a significant amount of RAM, but it does not provide information on the use of specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.
