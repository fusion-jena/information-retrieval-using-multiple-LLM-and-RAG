Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text only discusses the data acquisition, dataset creation, and fine-tuning of a pretrained CNN backbone using classical meta-metric learning architectures. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, that are performed after the model training.
