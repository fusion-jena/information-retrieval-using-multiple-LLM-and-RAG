Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to a hybrid algorithm that combines a Least Squares (LS) algorithm with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for parameter estimation, and it discusses the computational tools and methodology used. However, it does not mention deep learning models or any preprocessing steps associated with them.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
