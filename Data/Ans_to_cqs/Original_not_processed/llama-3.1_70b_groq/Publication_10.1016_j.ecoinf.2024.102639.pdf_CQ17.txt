Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for classification and dimensionality reduction, respectively. It also mentions the use of grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not provide information on regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of a regularization parameter (‘C’) in the SVM model, which is a common regularization technique used in SVMs to prevent overfitting. But this is not directly related to deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query about regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline.
