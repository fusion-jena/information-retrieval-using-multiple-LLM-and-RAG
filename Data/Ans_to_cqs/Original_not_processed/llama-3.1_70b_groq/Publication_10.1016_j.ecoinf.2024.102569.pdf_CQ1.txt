Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data from sources such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), are accessible for use. This suggests that public datasets and crowdsourced data may be one source of raw data.

Additionally, the context mentions "designed surveys" as a method for obtaining PA (presence-absence) data, which implies that surveys may be another method for collecting raw data.

There is no mention of sensors as a method for collecting raw data in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the available information, the methods utilized for collecting raw data may include:

* Public datasets (e.g., GBIF, eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, Observation.org)
* Crowdsourced data
* Designed surveys

Note that this answer is based on the limited information provided and may not be an exhaustive list of methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
