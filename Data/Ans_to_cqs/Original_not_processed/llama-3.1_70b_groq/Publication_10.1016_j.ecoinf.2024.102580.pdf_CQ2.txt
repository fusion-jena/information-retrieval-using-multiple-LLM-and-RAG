Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "aerial imagery" and "annotated images" as part of the ground-truth dataset used to train the deep learning models. This suggests that image data is likely used in the pipeline. Additionally, the text mentions the use of scripts and data output, which may imply the use of CSV or other text-based formats for data processing and analysis. However, this is not explicitly stated.
