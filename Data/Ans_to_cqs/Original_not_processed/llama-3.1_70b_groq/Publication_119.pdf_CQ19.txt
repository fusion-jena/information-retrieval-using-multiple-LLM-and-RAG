Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the frameworks used to build the deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, it does mention that a U-Net model was implemented with Keras, which is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Additionally, it mentions the use of the ArcGIS API for Python, specifically the arcgis.learn module, which is built on top of PyTorch.
