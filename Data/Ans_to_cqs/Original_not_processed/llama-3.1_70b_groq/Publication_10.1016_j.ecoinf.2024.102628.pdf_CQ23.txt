Answer:::

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, several measures were taken. Firstly, the dataset was expanded by incorporating multi-temporal data, which tripled the image pool for each transect. This was done by drawing data from a three-month span (March, September, and October 2015) across three environments. This approach helped to increase the diversity of the dataset, making it more representative of different scenarios.

Additionally, a Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) cross-validation approach was employed. In this approach, a complete 450m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training process and subsequently tested. This ensured that every multitemporal transect underwent both training and testing, preventing previous fold's information from being transferred. This approach helped to assess the model's performance, accounting for the data constraints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect was evaluated.

Furthermore, the use of transfer learning, specifically the pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, helped to leverage existing knowledge from broad datasets like ImageNet. This was particularly useful in this case, given the small size of the dataset.

Overall, the combination of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and transfer learning helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
