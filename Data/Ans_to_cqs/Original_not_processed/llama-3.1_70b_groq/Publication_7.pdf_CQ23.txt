Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a large dataset, specifically the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This suggests that the dataset may be diverse, but the exact measures taken to ensure diversity are not specified.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was fine-tuned on a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset, specifically the Western Australia (WA) subset, which consists of 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013). This suggests that the model was trained on a specific region and time period, but it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to evaluate the model's performance.

The context also mentions that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and diverse dataset, but it is not clear if this pre-training was used to improve the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the context provides some information about the dataset used to train the model, it does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
