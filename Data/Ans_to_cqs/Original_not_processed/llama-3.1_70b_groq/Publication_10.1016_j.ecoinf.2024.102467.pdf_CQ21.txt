Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context only discusses the design of a backbone to improve training speed and detection accuracy, and mentions the achievement of a lightweight algorithm with comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. It does not provide information on specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
