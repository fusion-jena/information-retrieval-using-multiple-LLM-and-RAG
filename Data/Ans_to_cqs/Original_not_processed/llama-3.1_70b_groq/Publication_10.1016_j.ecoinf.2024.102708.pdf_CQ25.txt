Answer: The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is object detection, specifically the detection of Pacific oysters. The models used are YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks), which are both widely used for object detection tasks. The models are trained to identify and locate Pacific oysters in images, likely obtained from drones or remote sensing platforms, as part of an ecological management effort.
