Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for Pl@ntNet is the ImageNet dataset. According to the provided context, the CNN architecture used is the inception model extended with batch normalization, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. This suggests that ImageNet serves as the primary dataset for pre-training the model, while the Pl@ntNet data is used for fine-tuning and adapting the model to the specific task of plant species identification.
