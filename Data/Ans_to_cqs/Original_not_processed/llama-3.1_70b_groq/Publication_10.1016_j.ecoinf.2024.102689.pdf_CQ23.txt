Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the researchers employed a rigorous methodology involving cross-validation. Specifically, they partitioned the dataset into ten equal sections, known as folds, for conducting folded cross-validation. This approach involves a cyclical process of training and testing, where one fold serves as the test set while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance metrics are recorded. By averaging these outcomes, the researchers obtained a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.

This cross-validation approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and can generalize well to unseen data. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the dataset was diverse or if stratified splitting was used. The text only mentions that the dataset was partitioned into ten equal sections, but it does not provide information on the diversity of the dataset or the splitting strategy used.
