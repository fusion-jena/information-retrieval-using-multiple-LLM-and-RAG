Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to ecology, geography, and remote sensing, with some references to deep learning and image processing. However, it does not provide information on specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

One of the references, "Cohen, N., Shashua, A., 2017. Inductive bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry" might be related to deep learning, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
