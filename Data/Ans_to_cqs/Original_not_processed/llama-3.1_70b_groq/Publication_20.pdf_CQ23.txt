Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained using four different training datasets (T1, T2, T3, and T4), which suggests that some form of data variation was used to train the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was tested on a separate test database, which implies that some form of data splitting was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, the exact method of data splitting is not specified.

The context also mentions that the model was trained using thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment, which suggests that the dataset was diverse and included different types of images. However, it is not clear if the dataset was balanced or if any measures were taken to address class imbalance.

Overall, while the context suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the exact methods used are not specified.
