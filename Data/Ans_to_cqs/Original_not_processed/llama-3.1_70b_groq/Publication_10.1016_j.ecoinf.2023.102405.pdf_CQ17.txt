Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on the AODEGRU model, its architecture, and its application to water pollution analysis in aquaculture. It discusses the model's components, such as the attention mechanism, and its advantages over other models. However, it does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I do not know the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization, as this information is not provided in the context.
