Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a research paper on land cover classification using multi-textural features and different machine learning algorithms. It includes tables and figures showing the results of the classification, as well as references to other research papers. However, it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
