Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the evaluation process of the models.

According to the context, the performance of the models is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the reference metric. A 10-fold Cross Validation is performed to obtain a reliable estimate of the MSE on the test set. Additionally, each evaluation predicts the output per test point through 1000 runs, which ensures an accurate reconstruction of the predicted output distribution.

The context also mentions that the uncertainty range of the MCD approach is wider than that of the VBI approach, as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, the performance of the two different architectures during the prediction phase on the whole test set is shown in Fig. 6.

However, it does not provide information on Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix as postprocessing steps. Therefore, I do not know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training, apart from the evaluation process mentioned in the context.
