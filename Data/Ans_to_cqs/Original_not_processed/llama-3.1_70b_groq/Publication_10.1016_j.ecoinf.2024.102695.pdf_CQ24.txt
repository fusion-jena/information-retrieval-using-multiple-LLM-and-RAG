Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on various machine learning approaches for predicting dissolved oxygen levels and water quality, as well as their performance metrics.

However, it does mention the use of techniques like Bayesian optimization, which can help in handling uncertainty and randomness in the model. Additionally, the context mentions the use of a validation set and a test set, which can help in evaluating the model's performance and generalizability.

But, specifically regarding the handling of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value, the context does not provide any information. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
