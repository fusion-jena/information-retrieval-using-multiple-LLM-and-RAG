Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention the use of Batch-Normalization, which is a technique used to normalize the input data for each layer in a neural network.

According to the context, Batch-Normalization is applied to every pre-activation (before applying the ReLU) to every class of NN model. This suggests that the input data for each layer is normalized using Batch-Normalization, which can help to improve the stability and speed of training.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model parameters were initialized with a uniform distribution U(0.03, 0.03), which may be considered a form of preprocessing or initialization step.

However, it is not clear if any other preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature scaling, or data augmentation were performed on the data before training the model. Therefore, the answer to the query is incomplete, and it can only be confirmed that Batch-Normalization was used as a preprocessing step.
