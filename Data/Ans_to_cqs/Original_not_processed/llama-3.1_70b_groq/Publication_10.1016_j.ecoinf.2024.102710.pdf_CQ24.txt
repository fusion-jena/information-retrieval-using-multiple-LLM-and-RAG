Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. However, it does mention that "in all cases, 5% of the samples are selected at random" during the active learning experiments. This suggests that randomness is introduced in the sampling process, but the context does not provide information on how this randomness is controlled or handled.

Additionally, the context mentions that "random sampling selects samples arbitrarily" as one of the sampling strategies, but it does not provide information on how the randomness is generated or controlled in this case.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values.
