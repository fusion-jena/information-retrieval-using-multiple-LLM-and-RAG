Answer:::
The purpose of the machine learning model (not deep learning model) is classification. According to the text, the model is used to classify all the pixels in an image. The model is based on Random Forest (RF) technique, which creates several decision trees randomly using the Gini coefficient to split them. A pixel is classified according to the majority vote of the decision trees. The model is used for large-scale classification, specifically for classifying complex regions with many categories.
