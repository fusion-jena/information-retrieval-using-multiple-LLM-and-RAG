Answer:
The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link associated with it. However, it does mention the use of the GBIF-Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org/) online database to obtain the coordinates of two oak species in the Iberian Peninsula. 

Therefore, I can only provide the link to GBIF, which is https://www.gbif.org/, but I do not know if this is the specific data repository link being asked for in the query.
