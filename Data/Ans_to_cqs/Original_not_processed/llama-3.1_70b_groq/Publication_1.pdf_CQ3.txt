Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily discusses the use of deep learning for biodiversity monitoring and the benefits of leveraging advances in big data and deep learning to extract meaningful information from wildlife data streams. It does mention that deep learning models are "completely trainable from data, usually in a supervised fashion," but it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
