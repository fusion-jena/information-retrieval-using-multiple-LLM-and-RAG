Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be related to a research paper on object detection in images, specifically in the marine ecosystem, and discusses topics such as dataset distribution, model evaluation, and performance metrics. It does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
