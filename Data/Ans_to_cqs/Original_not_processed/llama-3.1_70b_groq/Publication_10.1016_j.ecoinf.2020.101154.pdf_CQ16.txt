Answer: The criteria used to determine when training is complete is the early stopping technique. According to the provided context, early stopping was used to determine when to stop the model training to avoid overfitting. This technique allows the model to stop training when it reaches a certain level of convergence, thus preventing overfitting. In the case of the RI models, the number of iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW.
