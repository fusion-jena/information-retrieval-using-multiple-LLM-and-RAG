Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the ANN model used in the study. However, it does mention that the accuracy of the ANN model relies on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). This suggests that the dataset used for training and testing the model may have been carefully selected to ensure its representativeness and diversity.

Additionally, the context mentions that repeated training and testing were necessary to develop an optimal neural network and attain highly accurate SOC values of the validation dataset (Deb et al., 2017). This implies that some form of cross-validation or iterative testing may have been used to evaluate the model's performance and ensure its generalizability.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to ensure the model's generalizability. Therefore, it is unclear what specific measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability beyond the iterative training and testing process.
