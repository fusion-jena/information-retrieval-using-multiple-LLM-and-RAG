Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be discussing the evaluation metrics and results of various models, including SOWCEM, DCT-PLS, ESTARFM, and others, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
