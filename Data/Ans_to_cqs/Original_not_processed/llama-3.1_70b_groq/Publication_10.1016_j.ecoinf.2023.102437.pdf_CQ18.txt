Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is a progressive training and forecasting approach, where the model is trained and forecasted at different starting times. This approach involves conducting training and forecasts progressively by changing the starting time of the forecast but not using the information that is not accessible at the start of the prediction period. This ensures that each forecast is a fair cross-validation. 

The model performance is evaluated by calculating the prediction error, which is obtained by comparing the predicted value Ì‚ym+ma with the validation data ym+ma at different starting times. This approach allows for monitoring the model performance during training and evaluating its predictive performance.
