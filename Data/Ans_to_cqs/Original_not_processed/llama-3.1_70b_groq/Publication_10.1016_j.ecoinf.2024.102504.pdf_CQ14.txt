Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context appears to be a snippet from a research paper, focusing on the results of a study using exponential smoothing models to predict atmospheric pollutants. It includes tables with statistical overviews and model performance metrics, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
