Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training and application of the model for land-cover classification and monitoring, but it does not delve into the specifics of model deployment.

However, it can be inferred that the trained model was used for classification of target PSI (Plant Senescence Index) data, which suggests that the model was likely deployed in a manner that allows it to receive input data and generate output classifications. The context also mentions that the model can be used for continuous land monitoring, implying that the deployment process may have involved integrating the model with a system that can handle continuous data streams.

Unfortunately, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more detailed answer regarding the specific process followed for model deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.
