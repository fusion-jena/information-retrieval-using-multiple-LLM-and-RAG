Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-LSTM) for forecasting algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery using satellite data.

However, it can be inferred that the study used a dataset from the Zhoushan fishery in 2022, which might be a diverse dataset. The study also evaluated the performance of the models using various metrics such as RMSE, POD, and HSS, which could indicate some form of performance evaluation. Nevertheless, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques to ensure the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
