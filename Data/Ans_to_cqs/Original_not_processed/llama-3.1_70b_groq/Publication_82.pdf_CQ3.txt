Answer: 
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of different dataset types (Color, Gray scale, Leaf Segmented) but does not provide information on how the data was annotated. Therefore, I do not know the specific data annotation techniques used in this study.
