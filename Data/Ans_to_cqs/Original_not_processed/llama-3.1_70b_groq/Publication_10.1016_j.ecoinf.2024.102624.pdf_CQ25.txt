Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. The text mentions that the authors "classified all the input dataset combinations" and used three classifiers (RF, SVM, and MARS) to classify the data into two sets of classes (7C and 13C). The goal of the study is to identify plant populations using remote sensing, and the deep learning model is used to classify the data into different classes. There is no mention of segmentation or detection as the primary purpose of the model.
