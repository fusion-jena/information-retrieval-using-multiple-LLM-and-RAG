Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context appears to be discussing the use of random forest models and multiple linear regression for analyzing the influence of environmental factors on NAI (Nitrogen Absorption Index). It does not provide information on deep learning models or their preprocessing steps.

However, it does mention that the same subset data were used to apply a random forest model, and that the parameter optimization results of the random forest model were analyzed. But it does not provide details on any preprocessing steps that may have been involved.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
