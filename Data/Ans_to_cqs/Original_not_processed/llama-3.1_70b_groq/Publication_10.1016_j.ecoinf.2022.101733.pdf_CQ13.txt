Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and feature selection using Support Vector Machines (SVM), but it does not provide information about deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
