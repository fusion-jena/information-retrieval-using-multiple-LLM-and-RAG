Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is through the use of cross-validation and grid search. According to the provided context, the selection of hyperparameters for the SVM model was done through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation, aiming to mediate the balance between model complexity and its generalization prowess. Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained on a dimensionally reduced dataset, and the explained variance ratio was used to ensure that the distilled dataset retained the majority of the original data's variance. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored and evaluated during training using cross-validation and other metrics to ensure optimal performance.
