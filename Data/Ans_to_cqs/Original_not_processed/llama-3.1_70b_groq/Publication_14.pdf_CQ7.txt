Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that the author used a test dataset for model evaluation, which consisted of 70 test videos. It also mentions that the author collected images for each class and trained the fine-tuned neural network with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps.

While the context does not provide specific details on the data splitting criteria, it can be inferred that the author likely used a common approach in deep learning, such as splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. However, the exact proportions or criteria used for splitting the data are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that the context does mention that the author used a pre-trained model and fine-tuned it on their own dataset. This suggests that the author may have used a transfer learning approach, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset. In such cases, the data splitting criteria may be different from those used in traditional deep learning approaches.
