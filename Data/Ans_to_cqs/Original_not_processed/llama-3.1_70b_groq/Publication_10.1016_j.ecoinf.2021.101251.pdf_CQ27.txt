Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context appears to be focused on data publication, data integration, and data citation in the context of scientific research, particularly in the field of ecology. It discusses the process of data publication, data packaging, and metadata creation, but does not touch on the topic of deep learning model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the query.
