Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model is classification and object detection. Specifically, the model is designed for bee image classification and pollen-bearing bee detection. The classification network is used to classify images into different classes, while the object detection network (YOLOv5) is used to detect pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees in images. The model is also used for beehive monitoring, where it can serve different tasks such as detecting the presence of pollen-bearing bees.
