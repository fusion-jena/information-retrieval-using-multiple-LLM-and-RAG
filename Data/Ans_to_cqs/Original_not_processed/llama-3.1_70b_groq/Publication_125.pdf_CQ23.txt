Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention data augmentation techniques used in the model. 

According to the context, data augmentation techniques were applied to the dataset, as shown in Figure 6. These techniques include rotation, zooming, shearing, horizontal and vertical shifting, brightness adjustment, and horizontal and vertical flipping. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's accuracy was evaluated on both plain and encrypted data, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. This suggests that the model was tested on different datasets or under different conditions, which can also help evaluate its generalizability.

However, without more information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability.
