Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that audio data is likely used, as the context mentions "bat calls detection and classification method" and "echolocation signals of bats". This suggests that audio recordings of bat calls are being analyzed and classified using machine learning techniques.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image and audio classification tasks. However, without further information, it is unclear whether images or videos are also used in the pipeline.

The context also mentions the use of QGIS Geographic Information System and R programming language, which are typically used for geospatial analysis and statistical computing, respectively. This may suggest that CSV files or other tabular data formats are used to store and analyze metadata related to the bat calls, such as location and species information.

In summary, while the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated, it is likely that audio data is used, and possibly CSV files or other tabular data formats for metadata analysis.
