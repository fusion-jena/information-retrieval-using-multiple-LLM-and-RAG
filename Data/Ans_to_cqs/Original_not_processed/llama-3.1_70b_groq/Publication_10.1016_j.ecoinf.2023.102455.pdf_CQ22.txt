Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. However, it does mention some performance metrics, including:

* Nashâ€“Sutcliffe model efficiency
* Correlation Coefficient
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Squared Chi-square Distance

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of models, especially in the context of time series forecasting and regression tasks. However, it is unclear if these metrics are used to evaluate the specific deep learning model mentioned in the context.

Additionally, the context mentions "Best Performance" and "Worst Performance", but it does not provide further details on what these refer to or how they are measured.

Therefore, while we can infer that some performance metrics are used to evaluate the model, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the question of which specific metrics are used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
