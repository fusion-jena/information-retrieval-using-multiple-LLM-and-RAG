Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, which suggests that the model was tested on a specific dataset. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the number of convolutional kernels within each block was reduced from 64 to 32 to mitigate overfitting, which is a common technique to improve the generalizability of a model. The incorporation of residual structures is also mentioned, which can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. 

However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
