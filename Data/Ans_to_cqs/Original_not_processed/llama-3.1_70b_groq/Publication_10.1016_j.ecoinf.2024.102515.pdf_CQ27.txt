Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the deployment process of a trained deep learning model. The text discusses the challenges of using Twitter data for biodiversity observations, the filtering process to reduce invalid tweets, and the use of the Twitter API to search for specific tweets. However, it does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model, including model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
