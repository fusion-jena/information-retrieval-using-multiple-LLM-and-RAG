Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate and optimizer. The context only mentions that the hyperparameters for each SDM (Species Distribution Model) are described in Table 3, but the table is not provided. Additionally, the context discusses the use of a teacher-student structure in the training process, but it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
