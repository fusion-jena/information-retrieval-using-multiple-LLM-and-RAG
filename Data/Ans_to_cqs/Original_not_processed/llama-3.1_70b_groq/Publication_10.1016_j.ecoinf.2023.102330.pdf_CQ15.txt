Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the data augmentation process, the ARU DS model, and the use of a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for covey call detection. It does not provide information on the optimization techniques employed during the training process. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
