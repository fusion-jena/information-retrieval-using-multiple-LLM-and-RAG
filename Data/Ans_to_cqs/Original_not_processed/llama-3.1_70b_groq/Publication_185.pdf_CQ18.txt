Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the model results demonstrate that it is feasible to use small dataset to train deep learning models as long as the parameters are chosen properly, and that the MG and MO models can both get good training results and perform well in their own validation set.

It can be inferred that the model performance was monitored through the validation set, as the context mentions that the models perform well in their own validation set. However, the exact strategy or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training are not specified in the provided context.
