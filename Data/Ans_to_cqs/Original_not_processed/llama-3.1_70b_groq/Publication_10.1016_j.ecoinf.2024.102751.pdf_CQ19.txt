Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. It mentions the potential use of machine learning or deep neural networks to increase the accuracy of prediction, but it does not provide information on the specific frameworks used. The context appears to be focused on the application of remote sensing data and topographic indices to estimate soil moisture, but it does not delve into the details of the deep learning model implementation.
