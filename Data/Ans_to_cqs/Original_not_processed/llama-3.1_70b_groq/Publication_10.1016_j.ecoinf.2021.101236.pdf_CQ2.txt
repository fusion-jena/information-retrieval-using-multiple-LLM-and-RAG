Answer: The deep learning pipeline uses audio data, which is pre-processed to generate visual representations of sound, specifically mel spectrograms. These spectrograms are treated as monochrome input images of size 64 Ã— 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. Therefore, the primary data format used in the pipeline is audio, which is converted into a visual representation, but not in the classical sense of an image, video, or CSV file.
