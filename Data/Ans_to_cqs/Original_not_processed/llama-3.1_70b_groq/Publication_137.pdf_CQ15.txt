Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. However, it does mention that the learning decay rate is set to 0.7, which suggests that a learning rate decay schedule is used to adjust the learning rate during training. This is a common optimization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.
