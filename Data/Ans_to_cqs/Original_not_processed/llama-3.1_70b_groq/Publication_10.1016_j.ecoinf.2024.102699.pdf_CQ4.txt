Answer:

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are listed in Table 2 of the provided context. These techniques can be categorized into four domains: Time domain, Frequency domain, Spectrogram, and others. Here are the specific techniques applied:

Time domain:

* Gaussian noise
* Pink noise (background)
* Primary background noise soundscapes
* Secondary background noise soundscapes
* Primary background noise (BAD)
* Secondary background noise (BAD)
* Background noise (e.g., wind, thunder, or aircrafts)
* Mixed up random bird species

Frequency domain:

* Pitch shift
* Frequency mask

Spectrogram:

* Time mask
* Gain
* Loudness normalization

Others:

* Horizontal roll
* Vertical roll
* Horizontal flip
* Vertical flip
* Time stretch
* tanh-based distortion

These augmentation techniques are applied with a probability of 50% in the single augmentation methods (set 1). The context also mentions that the best combined augmentations would be applied to the best-performing model (ViT-B/16).
