Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. In fact, the context does not mention deep learning at all, but rather focuses on machine learning methods, specifically random forest models.

However, it does mention the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach to ensure accuracy and reliability of results, which can help to minimize bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results. Additionally, the context mentions that the process was repeated 15 times for each unique model to reduce the potential bias and variance related to random sampling.

But it does not provide information on techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection, which are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
