Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling (SDM) and environmental covariates, discussing methods like Maximum Entropy (Maxent), Random Forests (RF), and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). It does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
