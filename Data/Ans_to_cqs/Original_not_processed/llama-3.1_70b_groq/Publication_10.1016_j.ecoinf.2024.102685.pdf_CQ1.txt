Answer: According to the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as deep learning pipeline methods. However, it is mentioned that the field data were collected during the summer season in 2010 through inspection and sampling of the seabed. The presence or absence and the cover percentage of the three seagrass species were recorded for each sampling point. This suggests that the data collection method used in this study involves field observations and sampling of the seabed.
