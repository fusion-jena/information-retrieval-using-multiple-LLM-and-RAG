Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning and regression models for wildfire event prediction in Australia, discussing various studies and their methodologies. It does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

However, it is worth noting that the context mentions the use of historical environmental conditions and spatio-temporal variations in predicting wildfire events, which may involve data collection and preprocessing. Nevertheless, the specific techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, are not mentioned.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to the query.
