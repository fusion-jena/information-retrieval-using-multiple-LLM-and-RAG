Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions the SILIC framework, but it appears to be a custom framework for animal sound classification, and it does not specify the underlying deep learning framework used.

Therefore, I don't know which frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the deep learning model.
