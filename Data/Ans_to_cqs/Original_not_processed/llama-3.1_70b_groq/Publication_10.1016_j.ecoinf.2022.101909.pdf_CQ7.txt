Answer: The data was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing, with the presence and absence samples being separated. Additionally, 10% of the training dataset was used as a validation subset. This split was done to ensure that samples extracted from the same audio file were separated, both for training and for testing and validation, in order to reduce bias. However, to further reduce this bias, the extraction of samples was limited to a maximum of three per file.
