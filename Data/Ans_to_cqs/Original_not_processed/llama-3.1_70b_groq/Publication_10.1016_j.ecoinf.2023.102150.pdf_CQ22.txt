Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the number of all images. Precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated for each class. 

Precision is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Recall is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). 

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). 

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on the validation data set and the out-of-sample test data set.
