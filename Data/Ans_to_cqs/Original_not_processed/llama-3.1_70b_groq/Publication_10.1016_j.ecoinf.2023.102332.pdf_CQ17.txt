Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. The context primarily focuses on word embedding techniques, such as Word2vec and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and their applications in natural language processing and ecosystem services. It also mentions some specific studies and tools related to these topics, but does not discuss regularization methods or deep learning pipelines in general.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
