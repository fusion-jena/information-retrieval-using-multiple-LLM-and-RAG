Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of deep learning models for vegetation mapping, the workflow used to select and train the models, and the availability of the data and scripts. It does not discuss data preprocessing or techniques to address data bias.

However, it does mention the importance of having a ground-truth dataset consisting of annotated images to train the deep learning models. This suggests that the quality and diversity of the training data are crucial for the performance of the models. But it does not provide information on how data bias is addressed during preprocessing.

Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query.
