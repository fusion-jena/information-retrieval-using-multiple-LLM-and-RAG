Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of computer vision techniques, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT), for facial recognition of sika deer. It discusses the model architecture, experimental results, and related research papers, but does not provide information on data collection methods.

However, it can be inferred that the data collection method might involve capturing images of sika deer, possibly through camera traps or wildlife surveillance systems, as mentioned in the reference "Wildlife surveillance using deep learning methods" by Chen et al. (2019). Nevertheless, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact methods used for collecting raw data in this particular study.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query, and more information would be needed to accurately determine the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
