Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the data is first split up into several larger blocks, depending on coordinates, for cross-validation purposes. These blocks are then split into many smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model is trained on pre-labelled data, suggesting that some form of data preparation or annotation has taken place. However, the specific preprocessing steps involved are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model.
