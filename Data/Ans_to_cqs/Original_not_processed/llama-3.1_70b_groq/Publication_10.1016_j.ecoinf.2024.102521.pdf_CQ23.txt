Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily discusses the development of STARdbi, a platform for training and storing models, and the importance of data sharing and regulation in data-intensive fields. It also mentions a few research papers on using deep learning for computer vision in ecological research on arthropods, but it does not provide details on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used in those studies. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a specific answer to this question.
