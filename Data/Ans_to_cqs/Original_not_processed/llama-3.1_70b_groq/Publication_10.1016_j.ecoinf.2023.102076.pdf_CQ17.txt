Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the challenges of working with imbalanced datasets, the importance of sufficient training data, and the use of a hierarchical classification approach with pre-trained language models like BERT. It does not delve into the specifics of regularization techniques used in the pipeline. Therefore, I do not know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
