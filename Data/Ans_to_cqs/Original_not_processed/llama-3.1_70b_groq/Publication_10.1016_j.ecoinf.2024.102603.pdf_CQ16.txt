Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text describes the XGBoost model and its training process, but it does not provide information on the stopping criteria or convergence conditions.

However, it is mentioned that the XGBoost model trains a series of trees, with each subsequent tree starting its learning process anew, taking into account the correction for the residual values of the previous tree. This suggests that the model may continue to train until a certain number of trees have been trained or until a certain level of accuracy has been achieved.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer to this question.
