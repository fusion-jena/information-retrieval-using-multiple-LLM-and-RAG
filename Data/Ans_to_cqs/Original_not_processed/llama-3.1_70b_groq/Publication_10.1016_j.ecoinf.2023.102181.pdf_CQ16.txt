Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily discusses various validation approaches, including out-of-bag validation, spatial leave-one-out cross-validation, and covariance-weighted bagging, but it does not delve into the details of training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
