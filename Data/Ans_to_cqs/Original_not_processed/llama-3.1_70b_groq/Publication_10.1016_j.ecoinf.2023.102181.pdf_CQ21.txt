Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention the calculation of accuracy metrics, specifically the true validation statistics VE and RMSE, which are used to evaluate the model's performance.

According to the context, after the model training, the following steps are mentioned:

1. Prediction: The model is used to predict the value of the response across the full extent of the study area, ̂Zp(s).
2. Calculation of validation statistics: The predicted values are compared to the response raster surface, Z(s), to measure the true validation statistics VE and RMSE.
3. Simulation: The sequential simulation algorithm is used to simulate 500 Gaussian random fields, conditioned on the cross-validation residuals, and honouring the semivariogram model.
4. Calculation of accuracy metrics: The residual random field layers ̂R(s0) are transformed to obtain simulated ̂Zsim(s0) over the extent of the study area, and a range of accuracy metrics are calculated.

It is not clear if Saliency maps or Confusion matrix are calculated as part of the postprocessing steps, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
