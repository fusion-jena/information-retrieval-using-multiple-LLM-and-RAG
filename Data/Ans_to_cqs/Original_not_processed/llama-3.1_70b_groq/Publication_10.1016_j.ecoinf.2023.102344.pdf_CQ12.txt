Answer:::
The pipeline utilizes various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Specifically, the pre-trained CNN models used are EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. Additionally, the pipeline employs sequence neural networks composed of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layers. The most accurate model, BivalveNet, is a hybrid PCA-NCA and GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM sequence model. There is no mention of Transformer models in the provided context.
