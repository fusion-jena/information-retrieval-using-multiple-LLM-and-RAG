Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or the evaluation metrics used to assess its performance. The text discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, a type of supervised learning technique, to predict the richness and abundance of invasive alien species in the Kashmir Himalaya region. The performance of the RF model is not explicitly evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, the text mentions the use of variable importance scores to determine the relative importance of each predictor variable on the response variables (i.e., richness and abundance).
