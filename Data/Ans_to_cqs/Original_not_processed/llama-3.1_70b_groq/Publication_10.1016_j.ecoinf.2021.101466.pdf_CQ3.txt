Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of bounding boxes in the evaluation process. Specifically, it mentions that the Intersection over Union (IoU) is used as a threshold to determine whether a detection result is correct or incorrect, and that IoU is defined as the intersection over the union of the two bounding boxes, which are the ground-truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box.

This suggests that bounding box annotation is likely used in the pipeline, as the model is trained to predict bounding boxes around objects of interest. However, it does not provide information on other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that bounding box annotation is likely used in the pipeline, but the context does not provide information on other data annotation techniques.
