Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be focused on the use of automated signal recognition software for detecting ungulate vocalizations, specifically cattle calls. It mentions the use of Kaleidoscope Pro software and the development of supervised machine learning algorithms for ungulate detection, but it does not provide information on the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
