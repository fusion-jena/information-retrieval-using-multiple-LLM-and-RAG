Answer:

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research study on carbon emission accounts in China, specifically in the city of Xi'an. It discusses the study area, data sources, and methodology, but does not mention deep learning or data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not relevant to the provided context.
