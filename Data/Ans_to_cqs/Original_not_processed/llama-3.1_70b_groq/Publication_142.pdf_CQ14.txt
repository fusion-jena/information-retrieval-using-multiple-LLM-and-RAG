Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the data collection process, specifically searching for images on Flickr, and the evaluation of the images by an expert. However, it does not provide information on the model training process or hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I do not know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
