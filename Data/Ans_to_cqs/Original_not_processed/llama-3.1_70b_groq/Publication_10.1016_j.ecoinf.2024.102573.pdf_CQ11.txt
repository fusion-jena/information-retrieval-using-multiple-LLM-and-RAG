Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It appears to be a research paper or a report discussing the results of an experiment on bird species recognition using deep learning techniques. The text mentions various references and citations, but it does not provide a link to a data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
