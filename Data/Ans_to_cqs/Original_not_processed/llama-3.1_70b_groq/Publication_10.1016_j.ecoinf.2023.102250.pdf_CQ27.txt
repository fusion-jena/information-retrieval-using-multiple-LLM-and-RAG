Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context appears to be focused on the architecture and training of the model, including the use of spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition. It also mentions various datasets and references to research papers, but it does not provide information on model deployment.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
