Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data augmentation techniques or a deep learning pipeline. It appears to be discussing the preprocessing and classification of imagery data using techniques such as segmentation, classification, and model fitting using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The context mentions specific techniques used for preprocessing and classification, such as using NDVI, mean values of different bands, and texture variables, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.
