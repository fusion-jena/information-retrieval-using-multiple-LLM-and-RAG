Answer:::
I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of research papers and articles related to environmental science, ecology, and agriculture, but it does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its associated data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
