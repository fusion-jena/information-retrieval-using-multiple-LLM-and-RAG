Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps involved in training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

According to the context, the following preprocessing steps were involved in training the SVM model:

* Dimensionality reduction: The dataset was reduced in dimensionality to retain the majority of the original data's variance, as dictated by the explained variance ratio.
* Selection of distance metric: The distance metric, typically Euclidean, was selected based on the data's characteristics and the specific analytical prerequisites.

Additionally, the context mentions that the SVM model was trained on a dimensionally reduced dataset, but it does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning methodologies, but it does not provide specific information on the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model. Therefore, I do not know the specific preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model based on the provided context.
