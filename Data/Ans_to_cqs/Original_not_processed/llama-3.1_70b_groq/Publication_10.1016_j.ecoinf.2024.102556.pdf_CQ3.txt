Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context appears to focus on the architecture and components of the deep learning model, such as the multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet), Res2Net modules, and various convolutional layers.

However, it does mention instance segmentation in the context of wildlife videos, citing a paper titled "Instance segmentation and tracking of animals in wildlife videos: SWIFT-segmentation with filtering of tracklets" by Schindler and Steinhage (2022). This suggests that instance segmentation may be one of the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I can only provide a partial answer, and I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer to the query.
