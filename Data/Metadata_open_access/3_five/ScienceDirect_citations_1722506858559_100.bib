abstract = {Yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV) is a destructive plant virus that commonly affects crops, particularly okra, in India. The virus is transmitted by whiteflies and poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity. Infection with YVMV leads to distinct yellow vein patterns on leaves, stunted growth, reduced yield, and ultimately economic losses for farmers. Timely and accurate detection of YVMV is crucial for effective disease management. In this article, we present a novel method that employs advanced deep-learning models to identify YVMV-infected okra plants. The study leverages a dataset of over 2000 okra plant leaves that implements transfer learning models, including MobileNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 and recurrent neural networks (RNN) variants, including Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Gated recurrent unit (GRU). Additionally, three hybrid models, combining MobileNet with LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, are incorporated to capitalize on the characteristics of both MobileNet and RNNs through superior feature extraction and detection of temporal dependencies. The results demonstrate that the MobileNet model combined with all three RNNs achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing 99.27%. Notably, the MobileNet model integrated with GRU exhibits the most optimized performance with the least loss and greatest accuracy, facilitating improved disease management strategies and aiding in the yield of crops by reducing the impact of YVMV.}

abstract = {Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) has emerged as a pivotal technology for wildlife monitoring, generating vast amounts of acoustic data. However, the successful application of machine learning methods for sound event detection in PAM datasets heavily relies on the availability of annotated data, which can be laborious to acquire. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning and active learning techniques to address the data annotation challenge in PAM. Transfer learning allows us to use pre-trained models from related tasks or datasets to bootstrap the learning process for sound event detection. Furthermore, active learning promises strategic selection of the most informative samples for annotation, effectively reducing the annotation cost and improving model performance. We evaluate an approach that combines transfer learning and active learning to efficiently exploit existing annotated data and optimize the annotation process for PAM datasets. Our transfer learning observations show that embeddings produced by BirdNet, a model trained on high signal-to-noise recordings of bird vocalisations, can be effectively used for predicting anurans in PAM data: a linear classifier constructed using these embeddings outperforms the benchmark by 21.7%. Our results indicate that active learning is superior to random sampling, although no clear winner emerges among the strategies employed. The proposed method holds promise for facilitating broader adoption of machine learning techniques in PAM and advancing our understanding of biodiversity dynamics through acoustic data analysis.}

abstract = {Expanding digital data sources, including social media, online news articles and blogs, provide an opportunity to understand better the context and intensity of human-nature interactions, such as wildlife exploitation. However, online searches encompassing large taxonomic groups can generate vast datasets, which can be overwhelming to filter for relevant content without the use of automated tools. The variety of machine learning models available to researchers, and the need for manually labelled training data with an even balance of labels, can make applying these tools challenging. Here, we implement and evaluate a hierarchical text classification pipeline which brings together three binary classification tasks with increasingly specific relevancy criteria. Crucially, the hierarchical approach facilitates the filtering and structuring of a large dataset, of which relevant sources make up a small proportion. Using this pipeline, we also investigate how the accuracy with which text classifiers identify relevant and irrelevant texts is influenced by the use of different models, training datasets, and the classification task. To evaluate our methods, we collected data from Facebook, Twitter, Google and Bing search engines, with the aim of identifying sources documenting the hunting and persecution of bats (Chiroptera). Overall, the ‘state-of-the-art’ transformer-based models were able to identify relevant texts with an average accuracy of 90%, with some classifiers achieving accuracy of >95%. Whilst this demonstrates that application of more advanced models can lead to improved accuracy, comparable performance was achieved by simpler models when applied to longer documents and less ambiguous classification tasks. Hence, the benefits from using more computationally expensive models are dependent on the classification context. We also found that stratification of training data, according to the presence of key search terms, improved classification accuracy for less frequent topics within datasets, and therefore improves the applicability of classifiers to future data collection. Overall, whilst our findings reinforce the usefulness of automated tools for facilitating online analyses in conservation and ecology, they also highlight that the effectiveness and appropriateness of such tools is determined by the nature and volume of data collected, the complexity of the classification task, and the computational resources available to researchers.}

Nevertheless, accruing enough training samples might be difficult to achieve in the case of underwater fish images. We develop a novel methodology based on a siamese neural network that incorporates statistical fundamentals as motivation to overcome the few-shot context. Our work provides a hands-on experience and highlights on pitfalls when trying to apply photo-identification in a limited scenario, concerning both data quantity and quality, yet providing remarkable results over the test set including recaptures, where the model is capable of correctly identifying the 70% of the individuals. The findings of this study can be of strong impact for the research teams becoming familiar with deep learning approaches, as it can be easily extended to re-identify individuals of other marine species of interest from a conservation or exploitation point of view.}

abstract = {Precise estimations of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are essential for various environmental issues, including those related to agricultural ecosystem sustainability and water management. Indeed, the increasing demands of agricultural production, coupled with increasingly frequent drought events in many parts of the world, necessitate a more careful evaluation of crop water requirements. Artificial Intelligence-based models represent a promising alternative to the most common measurement techniques, e.g. using expensive Eddy Covariance (EC) towers. In this context, the main challenges are choosing the best possible model and selecting the most representative features. The objective of this research is to evaluate two different machine learning algorithms, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in a citrus orchard typical of the Mediterranean ecosystem using different feature combinations. With many features available coming from various infield sensors, a thorough analysis was performed to measure feature importance, scatter matrix observations, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient calculation, which resulted in the selection of 12 promising feature combinations. The models were calibrated under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) conditions to estimate ETa and save irrigation water. On average up to 38.5% water savings were obtained, compared to full irrigation. Moreover, among the different input variables adopted, the soil water content (SWC) feature appears to have a prominent role in the prediction of ETa. Indeed, the presented results show that by choosing the appropriate input features, the accuracy of the proposed machine learning models remains acceptable even when the number of features is reduced to only 4. The best performance was achieved by the Random Forest method, with seven input features, obtaining a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, respectively. Finally, the results show that the joint use of SWC, weather and satellite data significantly improves the performance of evapotranspiration forecasts compared to models using only meteorological variables.}

Synthetic data is also useful for general model testing and development, with many methods available for generating data from machine learning models (Raghunathan, 2021). Although not widely used in the context of ecological and environmental modelling, synthetic data can support and accelerate model testing and analyses where rightsholders are sensitive to data disclosure for study areas, or data collection is expensive. In the context of reef modelling, synthetic data can be used to support model analyses that can be published without referring to specific sites, reefs, or study areas. This is desirable in the context of decision support for restoration of the Great Barrier Reef. The Reef has many stakeholders and release of early modelling results for intervention scenarios for specific areas would be premature until management or intervention strategy options have been discussed with stakeholders and/or rightsholders. Synthetic data allows a path to publish model and method demonstrations to share knowledge with the reef decision support community without prematurely suggesting policy recommendations for reefs which are sensitive to rightsholders or stakeholders. We showcase a synthetic data pipeline developed for the reef decision-support system ADRIA (Adaptive Dynamic Reef Intervention Algorithms), using methods from the Python package Synthetic Data Vault (Patki et al., 2016) and others. The synthetic data models are developed to emulate the statistics of case-study reefs for publishing decision-support tool demonstrations, testing and method validation without revealing sensitive reef site information. This pipeline includes developing models for tabular (benthic/compositional reef data), spatial-temporal (wave and heat stress data) and spatial network data (coral larval connectivity). Conditional sampling methods which connect spatial relationships across datasets are used to develop synthetic reef data packages which mimic the statistical properties of the original dataset. The utility of the synthetic data is demonstrated on a sample reef data package, and methods used for anonymizing the data are detailed. The results are discussed in the context of formalizing synthetic data for reef modelling.

abstract = {Due to the expeditious rise in anthropogenic activities and rapid extractive pressure, protected areas in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) are experiencing significant losses in ecological diversity and a substantial decline in the potential for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The quantification of carbon sequestration and the understanding of its corresponding economic gain/loss are crucial for raising strict preservative concerns in protected areas with rich ecological and economic values. Transitions in land use land cover (LULC) trajectories from historical to future scenarios impact the dynamics of carbon storage and sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. The present study extends a comprehensive 40-year (1995–2035) assessment of carbon mapping (gain/loss) as well as an economic approximation of carbon sequestration in the Askot Wildlife Sanctuary (AWLS), Western Himalaya, using satellite data. This investigation presents a novel hybrid approach by infusing machine learning algorithms and a spatial-temporal technique-based MLPnn-Markov chain model for future LULC simulation with the InVEST model that incorporates carbon mapping and economic valuation. The results show that among all the land use classes, dense forest has the highest carbon density; however, it exhibits a decreasing trend from 1995 (5,695,878.41 Mg/ha) to 2035 (4,378,439.81 Mg/ha). The economic quantification of carbon sequestration was performed by applying sensitivity analysis combined with different carbon prices and discount rates from 2020 to 2035. The observed outcomes reveal significant economic losses due to rapid forest cover decline, as indicated by a negative net present value (NPV) ranging from a minimum of ∼US$ -8 million to a maximum of ∼US$ -53 million. This study develops a valuable database by providing evidence-based decision-making and guidance for the sustainable preservation of ecosystems in the Western Himalayas and similar regions worldwide, where forest carbon sequestration is of paramount importance. The findings of the study suggest sound provisions for the conservation of forested landscapes and the development of efficient voluntary and regulatory carbon trading markets to achieve stability in forest carbon stocks. In doing so, this interdisciplinary approach addresses the growing imperative of integrating ecological and economic aspects in the context of biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.}

abstract = {Accurate canopy cover estimation is essential for mature and early-stage young forests, as it guides forest management and silvicultural activities necessary for their growth and regeneration. However, obtaining precise measurements of canopy cover in the field is time-consuming and challenging, especially at the regional and landscape levels. Remote sensing techniques offer a promising alternative to traditional field-based measurements for estimating forest canopy cover. In this study, our objective is to estimate forest canopy cover using vegetation indices derived from the multispectral bands of PlanetScope (Planet Lab, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilise PlanetScope imagery data for estimating canopy cover in young boreal forests. Based on the analysis of four bands (green, blue, red, and near-infrared) from PlanetScope imagery, 43 vegetation indices, including four spectral bands and 13 salinity indices, were computed to select predictors in canopy cover modelling. Six regression models were employed to model canopy cover: linear, elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine. All the models demonstrated good performance for both the training dataset (R2 = 0.58–0.69) and the testing dataset (R2 = 0.59–0.64, RMSE = 0.16–0.18, rRMSE = 22%–23%, and MAE = 0.12–0.14). Based on the fit statistics in the training and testing datasets and the paired t-test, our study identified the light gradient boosting machine as the most suitable model for predicting canopy cover in young boreal forests. For the light gradient boosting machine, the R2 value was 0.69 (training), and for testing data, the R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.16, rRMSE = 22%, and MAE = 0.12. Therefore, we recommend that future researchers utilise Planet multispectral data and the light gradient boosting machine regression to estimate forest canopy cover at a higher spatial resolution. However, exploring additional machine learning algorithms and explicitly boosting methods when computing forest canopy cover using satellite remote sensing is strongly advised.}

Therefore, it is crucial to predict potential fire risks, especially in Dak Nong, a province located in the highland region of Vietnam, where forest farming is prevalent. In this study, the utilization of remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) revealed a decline in forest areas while agricultural rubber and industrial crops witnessed an increase. Furthermore, the integration of SPOT satellite images with UAV and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification algorithm proved highly efficient in mapping forest types in this province (OA = 81.446%, and Kappa = 0.803). To assess forest fire susceptibility in this study, a hybrid model known as Artificial bee colony-Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ABC-ANFIS) was employed, which indicated that the majority of forests in the area face high to very high of fires, particularly in bamboo and dipterocarp forest areas. The present model is proposed to suggest better prevention and suppression strategies. These facts can help managers stop fires or deal with this disturbance more effectively that may occur in the future. Policymakers and researchers in different areas, such as the limestone forest in the north or the Dipterocarp forests in Vietnam, may consider replicating this study to evaluate specific wildfire risks and develop appropriate fire prevention strategies tailored to their local circumstances.}

First, we innovatively employed the stacking method to fuse eight fundamentally different Machine Learning (ML) models, each utilising 20 and 17 feature bands, resulting in the development of a robust algorithm for estimating the Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake. The results demonstrate that the Stacking Model has achieved outstanding theoretical generalisation capability. Second, the sensitivity of the model to extreme value data in the sample was quantified, and we found that compared with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), the optimal performance of the Stacking Model improved by 12%, to some extent, it solved the problem of high-value underestimation and low-value overestimation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) results revealed that features such as Three Bands, Enhanced Three, Rrs492/Rrs560, Rrs705/Rrs665 play a crucial role in estimating Chla concentration. For the turbidity estimation, the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), Rrs705+Rrs560, Rrs865-Rrs740 made significant contributions. Finally, we utilised the Stacking Model to create spatiotemporal maps of the Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake from 2016 to 2022. We analysed the causes of the water quality changes and explored the driving factors. Compared with previous studies, this paper provides a new idea for the monitoring of lake water quality parameters by using the high resolution of Sentinel-2 image and the high precision of model fusion technology, these results can provide a reference for similar water area research and decision-making support for environment-related departments.}

To identify individual snow leopards in camera trap imagery, it is necessary to match individuals from a large number of images from multiple cameras and historical catalogues, which is both time-consuming and costly. The camouflaged snow leopards also make it difficult for machine learning to classify photos, as they blend in so well with the surrounding mountain environment, rendering applicable software solutions unavailable for the species. To potentially make snow leopard individual identification available via an artificial intelligence (AI) software interface, we first trained and evaluated image classification techniques for a convolutional neural network, pose invariant embeddings (PIE) (a triplet loss network), and compared the accuracy of PIE to that of the HotSpotter algorithm (a SIFT-based algorithm). Data were acquired from a curated library of free-ranging snow leopards taken in Afghanistan between 2012 and 2019 and from captive animals in zoos in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and the United States. We discovered several flaws in the initial PIE model, such as a small amount of background matching, that was addressed, albeit likely not fixed, using background subtraction (BGS) and left-right mirroring (LR) techniques which demonstrated reasonable accuracy (Rank 1: 74% Rank-5: 92%) comparable to the Hotspotter results (Rank 1: 74% Rank 2: 84%)The PIE BGS LR model, in conjunction with Hotspotter, yielded the following results: Rank-1: 85%, Rank-5: 95%, Rank-20: 99%. In general, our findings indicate that PIE BGS LR, in conjunction with HotSpotter, can classify snow leopards more accurately than using either algorithm alone.}

Geographical factors (e.g., elevation and distance to roads) were major determinants of PWD occurrence and largely contributed to explaining variability and partial dependence plots of each model. We developed an ensemble model composed of the RF and Maxent models to predict a potential risk map for PWD occurrence on a national scale. In South Korea, most territory was included potential risk of PWD occurrence, and it was predicted to be expanded in the future according to the climate change. The study results showed a high utility for use in surveillance and monitoring of PWD occurrence by inferring the spread pathway or spread direction of PWD based on the potential occurrence map.}

abstract = {Many ecosystems, particularly wetlands, are significantly degraded or lost as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Simultaneously, developments in machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, have greatly improved wetland mapping, which is a critical step in ecosystem monitoring. Yet, present deep and very deep models necessitate a greater number of training data, which are costly, logistically challenging, and time-consuming to acquire. Thus, we explore and address the potential and possible limitations caused by the availability of limited ground-truth data for large-scale wetland mapping. To overcome this persistent problem for remote sensing data classification using deep learning models, we propose 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training data based on each class's data availability. Both real and synthesized training data are then imported to a novel deep learning architecture consisting of cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks and vision transformers for wetland mapping. Results demonstrated that the developed wetland classifier obtained a high level of kappa coefficient, average accuracy, and overall accuracy of 96.99%, 97.13%, and 97.39%, respectively, for the data in three pilot sites in and around Grand Falls-Windsor, Avalon, and Gros Morne National Park located in Canada. The results show that the proposed methodology opens a new window for future high-quality wetland data generation and classification.

Traditional methods for estimating the age of panda are costly, time-consuming, and inaccurate. Additionally, these methods only forecast an age group rather than a real age, and lack a uniform standard. However, advances in deep learning and computer vision have given rise to fresh approaches to this problem. Classification models can be improved by using ordinal regression, which uses ordinal correlations across ages to reduce the non-stationary nature of aging tasks. In this study, we collected 8002 images from 272 pandas in various environments, whose ages ranged from 0 to 38. We applied a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) protocol to train seven Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on ordinal regression. Experiments were conducted on the Panda Age Dataset (PAD Full) and the Lite Panda Age Dataset (PAD Lite). The results were very encouraging and achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.51 and 2.41, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that this new tool can noninvasively predict the age of giant pandas in captivity and the wild. Continued development of computer vision technology will drive progress in ecology and conservation.}

However, estimating AGB in tropical forests is complex due to the diverse and intricate nature of vegetation, necessitating the integration of data from multiple sources. To tackle this challenge, our study utilized seven machine learning algorithms to analyze various combination of multisource datasets. We developed seven models/scenarios that incorporated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 as well as environmental factors such as topography, soil and climate to identify key variables for accurate estimation of AGB. For optimal performance, hyperparameters of the algorithms were fine-tuned through 10-fold cross-validation and their accuracy were assessed using the testing dataset. We found that the integrated model of satellite datasets, topography, climate, and soil variables exhibited the highest accuracy, where ensemble stacking, that combined multiple MLAs, proved to be reliable and best suited for predicting AGB (mean absolute error-3.97 Mg 0.1 ha−1, root mean square error-5.67 Mg 0.1 ha−1, and coefficient of determination - 0.82). Notably, the top predictor variables included Sentinel-2 bands (near infrared and green), soil properties (pH and soil organic carbon), and topography (elevation). The study emphasizes the significance of incorporating environmental variables (specifically topography and soil properties) along with Sentinel datasets to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation. This approach has the potential for broader applications, specifically in regions where vegetation productivity is governed by diverse environmental conditions.}

The current research proposes an approach to detect and segment salinity and vegetation areas at Siwa Oasis, Egypt, by combining remote sensing and building a deep learning neural network model-based U-NET algorithm to detect salinity change areas, anticipate further degradation, and predict soil quality indicators. To locate changes among the available images, standard image improvement, classification, and change detection methods have been used. We applied a deep learning modified U-Net (MU-NET) algorithm to segment and produce salinity maps. The MU-NET architecture is a two-level nested U-structure merged with a residual U-block (RUb), which consists of an encoder and a decoder. We applied RUb, which consists of several layers and skip connections. Different combinations of the salinity and vegetation indices were added to the original image to improve segmentation precision. The model was validated and trained using actual data samples collected over a 10-year period from the Landsat 8 satellite, which can monitor and analyse present land cover changes. The dataset consisted of 91 OLI and TIRS spectral images. Each one consists of eleven bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for bands 1 to 7 and 9. A field survey was used as the main source of data for comparing the proposed model's outputs to assess the error rate. The study region is experiencing an increase in soil salinity in all directions, particularly with regard to the spatial distribution of saline soils, not just the quantitative increase in salt-affected soils. These findings supported the acceleration of soil salinization and vegetation death. The proposed model achieved the highest performance results among the other models and literature and was based on applying method 12 using 13 image layers, with the highest accuracies of 91.27% and 90.83% for salinity and vegetation, respectively.}

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was built to estimate health indices. In addition, an autoencoder was adopted to produce manifold features that were used as inputs for the CNN model. Conventional machine learning models, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting, have been developed to estimate the TDI, BMI, and FAI. The results showed that the CNN with an autoencoder exhibited the best performance, with validation accuracies of Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.592 and 17.249 for TDI, 0.669 and 12.282 for BMI, and 0.638 and 13.897 for FAI, respectively. The autoencoder enhanced the nonlinear feature learning of the time series and static input data, which contributed to improving the CNN feature extraction for accurate estimation of aquatic ecosystem health indices compared to other data-driven approaches. Therefore, deep learning techniques can be used to investigate aquatic ecosystem health by successfully reflecting the quantitative and qualitative features of health indices.}

However, identifying effective analytical approaches for individual identification remains a challenge. Our study investigates how the use of different feature representations impacts our ability to distinguish between individual female Northern grey gibbons (Hylobates funereus). We broadcast pre-recorded calls from twelve gibbon females and re-recorded the calls at varying distances (directly under the tree to ∼400 m away) using autonomous recording units. We evaluated the effectiveness of using different automated feature extraction approaches to classify gibbon calls: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), embeddings from three pre-trained neural networks (BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec2), and four commonly used acoustic indices. We used a supervised classification approach (random forest) to classify calls to the respective female and compared two unsupervised clustering approaches (affinity propagation clustering and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering) to evaluate which features were most effective for distinguishing female calls without using class labels. We used MFCCs as a baseline as previous work has shown they can be used to distinguish high-quality calls of individual gibbon females. Human annotators could only identify calls in spectrograms from recordings <350 m from the playback speaker with signal-to-noise ratio ∼ 0 dB, so our results focus on these recordings. Using supervised classification, our results confirmed the efficiency of MFCCs and the use of embeddings from one neural network (BirdNET) for effective acoustic classification of gibbon individuals at closer recording distances (signal-to-noise ratio > 10 dB), while the remaining features did not perform well. Contrary to our expectations, we found that MFCCs outperformed all other features for the unsupervised clustering tasks at closer distances and none of the features performed well at farther distances. The ability to acoustically discriminate animals under noisy conditions and from low signal-to-noise ratio calls has important implications for monitoring populations of endangered animals, such as gibbons. Focusing only on high signal-to-noise ratio calls for individual discrimination may not be possible for rare sounds, and future work should focus on developing effective approaches of feature extraction that can perform well across noisy, real-world conditions with a limited number of training samples.}

abstract = {Transfer learning is extensively utilized for automatically recognizing and filtering out empty camera trap images that lack animal presence. Current research that uses transfer learning for identifying empty images typically solely updates the fully connected layer of models, and they usually select a pre-trained source model only based on its relevance to the target task. However, they do not consider the optimization of update layer selection, nor do they investigate the effect of sample size and class number of source domain data set used to construct the source model on the performance of the transfer model. Both of these are issues worth exploring. We answered these two issues using three different datasets and the ResNext-101 model. Our experimental results showed that when using 20,000 training samples to transfer the model from the ImageNet dataset to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, our proposed optimal update layers improved the accuracy of the transfer model from 92.9% to 95.5% (z = −7.087, p < 0.001, N = 8118) compared to the existing method of updating only the fully connected layer. A similar improvement was observed when transferring the model from ImageNet to the Lasha Mountain dataset. Additionally, our results indicated that when using 20,000 training samples to update the pre-trained model and increasing the sample size of the binary-class training dataset used to build the source model from 100,000 to 1 million, the accuracy of the transfer model improved from 90.4% to 93.5% (z = −3.869, p < 0.001, N = 8948). Similar results were obtained when constructing the source domain dataset using ten classifications. Based on these results, we drew the following conclusions: (1) using our proposed optimal update layers instead of the commonly used method of updating only the fully connected layers can significantly improve the model's performance. (2) The optimal update layers varied when the model transferred from different source domain datasets to the same target dataset. (3) The number of classes in the source domain dataset did not significantly impact the transfer model performance. However, the sample size of the source domain dataset positively correlated with the transfer model performance, and there might be a threshold effect.}

A province in the northern part of Vietnam was selected as a case study since the change in land cover has been considered crucial. The models were optimized/trained and validated using statistical indicators, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The trained models were further explained using SHAP values to understand better how they perform and the contribution of each feature to the overall estimates. The results showed that the three indicators of the proposed model were statistically better than those of the reference methods. Specifically, the hybrid model ended up at RMSE ∼13.87, MAE ∼ 10.62, and R2 ∼ 0.79 for the estimation of AGB. Based on the experience, such hybrid integration can be recommended as an alternative solution for biomass estimation.

In particular, in this work, we are interested in the discrimination within digital photos of beluga whales, which are known to be among the most challenging marine species to discriminate due to their lack of distinctive features. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach based on the use of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which are normally used to assess the privacy risks associated with releasing a particular machine learning model. More precisely, we demonstrate that the problem of discriminating between known and unknown individuals can be solved efficiently using state-of-the-art approaches for MIAs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets related to whales, two different neural network architectures, and three MIA clearly demonstrate the performance of the approach. In addition, we have also designed a novel MIA strategy that we coined as ensemble MIA, which combines the outputs of different MIAs to increase the discrimination accuracy while diminishing the false positive rate. Overall, one of the main objectives of our work is to demonstrate that the study of privacy attacks can also be harnessed positively, assisting in the resolution of practical issues encountered in the field of animal ecology.}

This is the case of the caesium-137 that has been present in the environment for many decades as a result of atmospheric tests, accidents such as Chernobyl and release from nuclear industries. With the recent advance in data-driven models, this study evaluate the relevance of a deep learning tool for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers. An encoder-decoder neural network, “Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks”(HRHN), is proposed notably for its ability to extract the most relevant temporal and spatial information from the databases. Three monitoring stations were studied, one on the Rhône River and two on the Loire River, all of them downstream nuclear industries in these catchments affected by the global fallout and the accident of Chernobyl. The objective is to predict the future concentration from a set of variables providing past information on water discharge, washout flux and industrial radioactive releases. Once optimised, the model generates first results in agreement with the real concentration curves by correctly following the main trends, with a NSE of 0.89, 0.53 and 0.35 respectively for the Rhone station and the two stations on the Loire. The main reason of inaccuracies is due to the quantity of data available. The originality of this model is its capacity to make predictions on different catchment areas. In fact the training was conducted on the Rhône station as the range of the concentration was higher (from 265.4 to 2700.0 Bq/kg) and the testing on the two Loire station. Another encoder-decoder model DA-RNN (Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network) was also evaluate in order to compare the performance of an alternative architecture, without convolution layer. The conclusion is that HRHN remains more powerful in the predictions on the 3 systems. With these first interesting results for HRHN, further investigations should be taken into account for other pollutants than caesium-137 to better understand the robustness of the model.}

Unlike classical statistical and machine learning methods, deep learning models use time series data directly as predictors and identify the features that are most relevant from a predictive perspective. We demonstrate for the first time the application of this approach to predict short-term temporal trends in the number of Aedes aegypti mosquito eggs across Madeira Island for the period 2013 to 2019. Specifically, we apply the deep learning models to predict whether, in the following week, the number of Ae. aegypti eggs will remain unchanged, or whether it will increase or decrease, considering different percentages of change. We obtained high predictive performance for all years considered (mean AUC = 0.92 ± 0.05 SD). Our approach performed better than classical machine learning methods. We also found that the preceding numbers of eggs is a highly informative predictor of future trends. Linking our approach to disease transmission or importation models will contribute to operational, early warning systems of arboviral disease risk.}

abstract = {Bioacoustics, the exploration of animal vocalizations and natural soundscapes, has emerged as a valuable tool for studying species within their habitats, particularly those that are challenging to observe. This approach has broadened the horizons of biodiversity assessment and ecological research. However, monitoring wildlife with acoustic recorders produces large volumes of data that can be labor-intensive to analyze. Deep learning has recently transformed many computational disciplines by enabling the automated processing of large and complex datasets and has gained attention within the bioacoustics community. Despite the revolutionary impact of deep learning on acoustic detection and classification, attaining both high detection accuracy and low false positive rates in bioacoustics remains a significant challenge. An intriguing yet unexplored avenue for enhancing deep learning in bioacoustics involves the utilization of contextual information, such as time and location, to discern animal vocalizations within acoustic recordings. As a first case study, a multi-branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to classify 22 different bird songs using spectrograms as a first input, and spatial metadata as a secondary input. A comparison was made to a baseline model with only spectrogram input. A geographical prior neural network was trained, separately, to estimate the probability of a species occurring at a given location. The output of this network was combined with the baseline CNN. As a second case study, temporal data and spectrograms were used as input to a multi-branch CNN for the detection of Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus) calls, the world’s rarest primate. Our findings demonstrate that adding metadata to the bird song classifier significantly improves classification performance, with the highest improvement achieved using the geographical prior model (F1-score of 87.78% compared to 61.02% for the baseline model). The multi-branch CNNs also proved efficient (F1-scores of 76.87% and 78.77%) and simpler to use than the geographical prior. In the second case study, our findings revealed a decrease in false positives by 63% (94% of the calls were detected) when the metadata was used by the multi-branch CNN, and an increase of 19% in gibbon detection. This study has uncovered an exciting new avenue for improving classifier performance in bioacoustics. The methodology described in this study can assist ecologists, wildlife management teams, and researchers in reducing the amount of time spent analyzing large acoustic datasets obtained from passive acoustic monitoring studies. Our approach can be adapted and applied to other calling species, and thus tailored to other use cases.}

abstract = {Oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) represent an ecologically significant species found throughout estuaries along the eastern coast of the United States. While these crevice-dwelling fish can be challenging to observe in their habitats, it is possible to infer their distribution and aspects of their behavior by recording the sounds they produce. The task of cataloging the distinctive advertisement boatwhistle sounds produced by male toadfish to attract females throughout the spring and summer is automated using a multi-step process. Candidate boatwhistles are first identified by template matching using a suite of synthetic spectrogram kernels formed to mimic the two lowest frequency harmonic tones within the boatwhistle. Candidate boatwhistle calls are identified based on the correlation between these kernels and a low-frequency spectrogram of the data. Next, frequency-reassigned spectrogram images of these candidates are formed and input into the pre-trained ResNet-50 convolutional neural network. Finally, the activations from a deep, fully connected layer within this network are extracted and passed to a one-vs-all support-vector-machine classifier, which separates boatwhistles from the larger set of candidate signals. This classifier model was trained and evaluated using a labeled dataset of over 20,000 candidate signals generated over diverse acoustic conditions within Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. The accompanying software provides an effective and efficient tool to monitor boatwhistle calls, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution, behavioral patterns, and ecological roles played by oyster toadfish.}

abstract = {This study assessed water quality (WQ) in Tongi Canal, an ecologically critical and economically important urban canal in Bangladesh. The researchers employed the Root Mean Square Water Quality Index (RMS-WQI) model, utilizing seven WQ indicators, including temperature, dissolve oxygen, electrical conductivity, lead, cadmium, and iron to calculate the water quality index (WQI) score. The results showed that most of the water sampling locations showed poor WQ, with many indicators violating Bangladesh's environmental conservation regulations. This study employed eight machine learning algorithms, where the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model demonstrated superior performance (training RMSE = 1.77, testing RMSE = 0.0006) in predicting WQI scores. To validate the GPR model's performance, several performance measures, including the coefficient of determination (R2), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the model efficiency factor (MEF), Z statistics, and Taylor diagram analysis, were employed. The GPR model exhibited higher sensitivity (R2 = 1.0) and efficiency (NSE = 1.0, MEF = 0.0) in predicting WQ. The analysis of model uncertainty (standard uncertainty = 7.08 ± 0.9025; expanded uncertainty = 7.08 ± 1.846) indicates that the RMS-WQI model holds potential for assessing the WQ of inland waterbodies. These findings indicate that the RMS-WQI model could be an effective approach for assessing inland waters across Bangladesh. The study's results showed that most of the WQ indicators did not meet the recommended guidelines, indicating that the water in the Tongi Canal is unsafe and unsuitable for various purposes. The study's implications extend beyond the Tongi Canal and could contribute to WQ management initiatives across Bangladesh.}

The innovation lies in introducing a comprehensive feature representation by integrating convolutional features with geometric, texture, shape, and multispectral features for classification tasks. In this study, a two-level hierarchical plant classification model is proposed to address the challenges of inter-class similarity and intra-class variations. The first level classifies 100 medicinal plant species into 11 groups based on visual similarities among the plants. At level two, the specific plant species containing in each group are predicted using Random Forest classifier. The evaluation is performed at two levels to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed model. The performance analysis compares the effectiveness of individual feature types against the composite feature model. Performance is also evaluated based on specific groups that demonstrate high similarity between classes and intra-class variations among the plant species separately. Furthermore, the generality of the model is tested using two self-created datasets-RTL80 and RTP40, requiring more than 300 man-hours to collect. Experimental results demonstrate a promising accuracy of 94.54% on GSL100 leaf dataset and 75.46% on RTL80 and RTP40 real-time datasets reflecting the superiority of the proposed hierarchical model over state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Accurately estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in forest ecosystems facilitates efficient resource management, carbon accounting, and conservation efforts. This study examines the relationship between predictors from Landsat-9 remote sensing data and several topographical features. While Landsat-9 provides reliable data crucial for long-term monitoring, it is part of a broader suite of available remote sensing technologies. We employ machine learning algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest (RF), alongside linear regression techniques like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The primary objectives of this study encompass two key aspects. Firstly, the research methodically selects optimal predictor combinations from four distinct variable groups: Landsat-9 (L1) data, a fusion of Landsat-9 data and Vegetation-based indices (L2), and the integration of Landsat-9 data with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) (L3) and the combination of best predictors (L4) derived from L1, L2, and L3. Secondly, the research systematically assesses the effectiveness of different algorithms to identify the most precise method for establishing any potential relationship between field-measured AGB and predictor variables. Our study revealed that the Random Forest (RF) model was the most efficient method utilizing Landsat-9 OLI and SRTM DEM (L3) predictors, achieving remarkable accuracy. This conclusion was reached by assessing its outstanding performance when compared to an independent validation dataset. The RF model exhibited remarkable accuracy, presenting relative mean absolute error (RMAE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and R2 values of 14.33%, 22.23%, and 0.81, respectively. The XGBoost model is the subsequent choice with RMAE, RRMSE, and R2 values of 15.54%, 23.85%, and 0.77, respectively. The study further highlights the significance of specific spectral bands, notably B4 and B5 from Landsat 9 OLI data, in capturing spatial AGB distribution patterns. Integration of vegetation-based indices, including TNDVI, NDVI, RVI, and GNDVI, further refines AGB mapping precision. Elevation, slope, and the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) are crucial proxies for representing biophysical and biological mechanisms impacting AGB. Through the utilization of openly accessible fine-resolution data and employing the RF algorithm, the research demonstrated promising outcomes in the identification of optimal predictor-algorithm combinations for forest AGB mapping. This comprehensive approach offers a valuable avenue for informed decision-making in forest management, carbon assessment, and ecological monitoring initiatives.}

Our study addressed this gap by systematically evaluating 17 machine and deep learning models in predicting oil palm yield, incorporating various agronomic parameters, e.g., soil composition, climatic conditions, plant age, and farming techniques. This holistic approach enhances the application of machine and deep learning in agriculture. Using the feature selection technique and a maximum depth of 32 and 1000 estimators, the Extra Trees Regressor exhibited positive performance, i.e., MSE = 860.36 and an R2 = 0.65, and stands out among the 17 models evaluated. Our findings also showed that incorporating a comprehensive agronomic dataset is critical to accurate yield prediction. Hence, this model and approach have the potential to be a robust decision-making tool for agronomists and farmers in the oil palm industry, setting the stage for future innovations in sustainable agriculture practices.}

abstract = {Species distribution modeling is a highly versatile tool for understanding the intricate relationship between environmental conditions and species occurrences. However, the available data often lacks information on confirmed species absence and is limited to opportunistically sampled, presence-only observations. To overcome this limitation, a common approach is to employ pseudo-absences, which are specific geographic locations designated as negative samples. While pseudo-absences are well-established for single-species distribution models, their application in the context of multi-species neural networks remains underexplored. Notably, the significant class imbalance between species presences and pseudo-absences is often left unaddressed. Moreover, the existence of different types of pseudo-absences (e.g., random and target-group background points) adds complexity to the selection process. Determining the optimal combination of pseudo-absences types is difficult and depends on the characteristics of the data, particularly considering that certain types of pseudo-absences can be used to mitigate geographic biases. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges can be effectively tackled by integrating pseudo-absences in the training of multi-species neural networks through modifications to the loss function. This adjustment involves assigning different weights to the distinct terms of the loss function, thereby addressing both the class imbalance and the choice of pseudo-absence types. Additionally, we propose a strategy to set these loss weights using spatial block cross-validation with presence-only data. We evaluate our approach using a benchmark dataset containing independent presence-absence data from six different regions and report improved results when compared to competing approaches.}

abstract = {Chagas disease (CD) is a public-health concern across Latin America. It is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite transmitted by blood-sucking triatomine bugs. Automated identification of triatomine bugs is a potential means to strengthen CD vector surveillance. To be broadly useful, however, automated systems must draw on algorithms capable of correctly identifying bugs from images taken with ordinary cellphone cameras at varying angles or positions. Here, we assess the performance of five machine-learning algorithms at identifying the main CD vector genera (Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius) based on bugs photographed at different angles/positions with a 72-dpi cellphone camera. Each bug (N = 730; 13 species) was photographed at nine angles representing three positions: dorsal-flat, dorsal-oblique, and front/back-oblique. We randomly split the 6570-picture database into training (80%) and testing sets (20%), and then trained and tested a convolutional neural network (AlexNet, AN); three boosting-based classifiers (AdaBoost, AB; Gradient Boosting, GB; and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting, HB); and a linear discriminant model (LD). We assessed identification accuracy and specificity with logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. Differences in performance across algorithms were mainly driven by AN's essentially perfect accuracy and specificity, irrespective of picture angle or bug position. HB predicted accuracies ranged from ∼0.987 (Panstrongylus, dorsal-oblique) to >0.999 (Triatoma, dorsal-flat). AB accuracy was poor for Rhodnius (∼0.224–0.282) and Panstrongylus (∼0.664–0.729), but high for Triatoma (∼0.988–0.991). For Panstrongylus, LD and GB had predicted accuracies in the ∼0.970–0.984 range. AB misclassified ∼57% of Rhodnius and Panstrongylus as Triatoma, whereas specificity ranged from ∼0.92 to ∼1.0 for the remaining algorithm-genus combinations. Dorsal-flat pictures appeared to improve algorithm performance slightly, but angle/position effects were overall weak-to-negligible. We conclude that, when high-performance algorithms such as AN are used, the angles or positions at which bugs are photographed seem unlikely to hinder cellphone picture-based automated identification of CD vectors, at least at the genus level. Future research should focus on combining mixed-quality pictures and state-of-the-art algorithms to (i) identify triatomine adults to the species level and (ii) distinguish triatomine nymphs (i.e., immature stages) from adults and from other insects.}

Consequently, it is crucial to highlight the regions prone to future landslides by examining the correlation between past landslides and various geo-environmental factors. This study aims to investigate the optimal data selection and machine learning model, or ensemble technique, for evaluating the vulnerability of areas to landslides and determining the most accurate approach. To attain our objectives, we considered two different scenarios for selecting landslide-free random points (a slope threshold and a buffer-based approach) and performed a comparative analysis of five machine learning models for landslide susceptibility mapping, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The study area for this research is an area in Polk County in Western North Carolina that has experienced fatal landslides, leading to casualties and significant damage to infrastructure, properties, and road networks. The model construction process involves the utilization of a dataset comprising 1215 historical landslide occurrences and 1215 non-landslide points. We integrated a total of fourteen geospatial data layers, consisting of topographic variables, soil data, geological data, and land cover attributes. We use various metrics to assess the models' performance, including accuracy, F1-score, Kappa score, and AUC-ROC. In addition, we used the seeded-cell area index (SCAI) to evaluate map consistency. The ensemble of the five models using Weighted Average produces outstanding results, with an AUC-ROC of 99.4% for the slope threshold scenario and 91.8% for the buffer-based scenario. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of non-landslide random sampling on model performance in landslide susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, by optimally identifying landslide-prone regions and hotspots that need urgent risk management and land use planning, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in analyzing landslide susceptibility and providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and disaster risk reduction initiatives.}

Historical documents are, therefore, an important piece in the understanding of the impact and consequences of land usage change. This, in turn, is important in the search of restoration projects that can be conducted to turn and reduce harmful and unsustainable effects originating from changes in the land-usage. This work extracts information on the historical location and geographical distribution of wetlands, from hand-drawn maps. This is achieved by using deep learning (DL), and more specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN model is trained on a manually pre-labelled dataset on historical wetlands in the area of Jönköping county in Sweden. These are all extracted from the historical map called “Generalstabskartan”. The presented CNN performs well and achieves a F1-score of 0.886 when evaluated using a 10-fold cross validation over the data. The trained models are additionally used to generate a GIS layer of the presumable historical geographical distribution of wetlands for the area that is depicted in the southern collection in Generalstabskartan, which covers the southern half of Sweden. This GIS layer is released as an open resource and can be freely used. To summarise, the presented results show that CNNs can be a useful tool in the extraction and digitalisation of non-textual information in historical documents, such as historical maps. A modern GIS material that can be used to further understand the past land-usage change is produced within this research. Previously, no material of this detail and extent have been available, due to the large effort needed to manually create such. However, with the presented resource better quantifications and estimations of historical wetlands that have been lost can be made.}

Automated signal recognition software reduces the expert time needed for recording analyses and allows researchers and managers to manage large acoustic datasets. The application of state-of-the-art techniques for automated identification, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, may be challenging for ecologists and managers without informatics or engineering expertise. Here, we evaluated the use of AudioMoth — a low-cost and open-source sound recorder — to monitor a threatened and patchily distributed species, the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). Passive acoustic monitoring was carried out across 17 potential wetlands in north Spain. We also assessed the performance of BirdNET — an automated and freely available classifier able to identify over 3000 bird species — and Kaleidoscope Pro — a user-friendly recognition software — to detect the vocalizations and the presence of the target species. The percentage of presences and vocalizations of the Eurasian bittern automatically detected by BirdNET and Kaleidoscope Pro software was compared to manual annotations of 205 recordings. The species was effectively recorded up to distances of 801–900 m, with at least 50% of the vocalizations uttered within that distance being manually detected; this distance was reduced to 601–700 m when considering the analyses carried out using Kaleidoscope Pro. BirdNET detected the species in 59 of the 63 (93.7%) recordings with known presence of the species, while Kaleidoscope detected the bittern in 62 recordings (98.4%). At the vocalization level, BirdNet and Kaleidoscope Pro were able to detect between 76 and 78%, respectively, of the vocalizations detected by a human observer. Our study highlights the ability of AudioMoth for detecting the bittern at large distances, which increases the potential of that technique for monitoring the species at large spatial scales. According to our results, a single AudioMoth could be useful for monitoring the species' presence in wetlands of up to 150 ha. Our study proves the utility of passive acoustic monitoring, coupled with BirdNET or Kaleidoscope Pro, as an accurate, repeatable, and cost-efficient method for monitoring the Eurasian bittern at large spatial and temporal scales. Nonetheless, further research should evaluate the performance of BirdNET on a larger number of species, and under different recording conditions (e.g., more closed habitats), to improve our knowledge about BirdNET's ability to perform bird monitoring. Future studies should also aim to develop an adequate protocol to perform effective passive acoustic monitoring of the Eurasian bittern.}

To further improve the performance of automated call recognisers, we investigated the development of efficient data annotation strategies and how best to address uncertainty around ambiguous vocalisations. These challenges present a particular problem for species whose vocalisations are rare in field recordings, where collecting enough training data can be problematic and a species' vocalisations may be poorly documented. We provide an open access solution to address these challenges using two strategies. First, we applied an active learning framework to iteratively improve a convolutional neural network (CNN) model able to automate call identification for a target rare bird species, the southern black-throated finch (Poephila cincta cincta). We collected 9098 h of unlabelled audio recordings from a field study in the Desert Uplands Bioregion of Queensland, Australia, and used active learning to prioritise human annotation effort towards data that would best improve model fit. Second, we progressed methods for managing ambiguous vocalisations by applying machine learning methods more commonly used in medical image analysis and natural language processing. Specifically, we assessed agreement among human annotators and the CNN model (i.e. inter-annotator agreement) and used this to determine realistic performance outcomes for the CNN model and to identify areas where inter-annotator agreement may be improved. We also applied a classification approach that allowed the CNN model to classify sounds into an ‘uncertain’ category, which replicated a requirement of human-annotation and facilitated the comparison of human-model annotation performance. We found that active learning was an efficient strategy to build a CNN model where there was limited labelled training data available, and target calls were extremely rare in the unlabelled data. As few as five active learning iterations, generating a final labelled dataset of 1073 target calls and 5786 non-target sounds, were required to train a model to identify the target species with comparable performance to experts in the field. Assessment of inter-annotator agreement identified a bias in our model to align predictions most closely with those of the primary annotator and identified significant differences in inter-annotator agreement among subsets of our acoustic data. Our results highlight the use of inter-annotator agreement to understand model performance and identify areas for improvement in data annotation. We also show that excluding ambiguous vocalisations during data annotation results in an overestimation of model performance, an important consideration for datasets with inter-annotator disagreement.}

Therefore, it is important to be able to predict the fundamental fluxes in crops, in this case vineyards, such as sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE) and carbon dioxide flux (CO2), in order to know their capacity to adapt to the environmental effects of climate change. In this study, Linear Regression (LR), Elastic Net (EN) regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Gaussian-Process (GP), Decision Tree (TREE) Regression, Random Forest (RF) Regression, XGBoost (XGB) Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) models have been applied to predict fundamental fluxes of an eddy-covariance station from conventional meteorological parameters. These models reproduced well the estimations of three output parameters from the eddy-covariance station. The performance of each predictive model was evaluated using Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). The findings indicate that for the variable H, the GP model outperformed the SVR and all other models, achieving an R2 value of 0.99. Conversely, the SVR demonstrated superior performance for the variables LE and CO2, with R2 values of 0.96 for both. In summary, these findings suggest that the three models proposed show a robust performance in the prediction of the studied fluxes, underlining their versatility and adaptability to the various environmental conditions of the vineyard.}

abstract = {Forest fires pose significant challenges by disrupting ecological balance, impacting socio-economic harmony, and raising global concerns. North-East India (NEI) experiences high incidences of forest fires, making it crucial to implement suitable management measures considering the driving forces influencing fire likelihood. This study aims to identify forest fire susceptibility zones in NEI by using five machine-learning modeling approaches, Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and an ensemble method. Forest fire data from the SNPP – VIIRS sensor (2018–2019) were rectified for spatial autocorrelation. Thirty-two responsive predictor variables related to topographic, climatic, biophysical, and anthropogenic factors were used as model inputs and multicollinearity analysis was performed to eliminate highly correlated predictors. Results indicate that the southern and southeastern regions of NEI, characterized by ample solar radiation, enhanced vegetation index, high human population density, and jhum cultivation, contribute significantly to higher susceptibility to forest fires. The Random Forest model performs best among the models employed, achieving an AUC value of 0.87. The ensemble susceptibility map, binarized based on AUC weighting, covers 29.54% of the total geographic area and 44.42% of the forested area of NEI. The vulnerability levels vary among states, with Mizoram showing the highest susceptibility at 89.27% and Sikkim exhibiting the lowest vulnerability at only 0.49% of their respective geographic areas. This map provides valuable insights for implementing effective forest fire management plans in the region. Moreover, the methodology utilized in this study, which incorporates satellite imagery, GIS techniques, and improved modeling techniques, can be replicated in any geographical region worldwide to facilitate effective forest fire management at a regional to large scale.}

Such models should be generalizable to unseen data. Among various machine learning models, heterogeneous ensembles are known to be generalizable owing to their structural diversity. The present study compares the generalizability of heterogeneous ensembles with those of homogeneous ensembles and single models. The models classified five grades (very good to very poor) of river health indices (RHIs) for three taxa (benthic macroinvertebrates, fish, and diatoms) given various environmental factors (water quality, hydrology, meteorological, land cover, and stream properties) as inputs. The data were monitored at 2915 sites in the four major river watersheds in South Korea during the 2016–2021 period. The results indicated better generalizability of the heterogeneous and homogeneous ensembles than single models. Moreover, heterogeneous ensembles tended to show higher generalizability than homogeneous ensembles, although the differences were marginal. Weighted soft voting was the most generalizable of the heterogeneous ensembles, with losses ranging from 0.49 to 0.59 across the three taxa. Weighted soft voting also delivered acceptable classification performance on the test set, with accuracies ranging from 0.42 to 0.52 across the taxa. The relative contributions of the environmental factors to RHI predictions and the directions of their effects agreed with established knowledge, confirming the reliability of the predictions. However, as heterogeneous ensembles have been rarely applied to RHI prediction, the extent to which heterogeneous ensembles improve the generalizability of prediction must be investigated in future studies.}

As technology advances, leading enterprises and ecological organisations are building and mobilising new devices supported by cutting-edge marine mechatronics solutions to explore and harness this challenging environment. Automated tracking of these types of industries and the marine life around them can help us figure out what's causing the current changes in species numbers, predict what could happen in the future, and create the right policies to help reduce the environmental impact and make the planet more sustainable. The objective of this study is to create a new platform for the automated detection of irregularly shaped man-made marine objects (ISMMMOs) in large datasets derived from marine aerial survey imagery. In this context, a novel nonparametric methodology, which harbours several hybrid statistical Machine Learning (ML) methods, was developed to automatically segment ISMMMOs on the sea surface in large surveys. This methodology was validated on a wide range of marine domains, providing robust empirical proof of concept. This approach enables the detection of ISMMMOs automatically, without any prior training, with accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), specificity (Sp) and sensitivity(Se) over 0.95. The outlined methodology can be utilised for a variety of purposes, but it's especially useful for researchers and policymakers who want to keep an eye on how the maritime industry is deploying and make sure the right policies are in place to meet regulatory and legal requirements to promote maritime tech innovation and shape what the future looks like for the marine ecosystem. For the first time in the literature, a method, the so-called ISMMMOD, has been developed to automate the detection of all types of ISMMMOs by statistical ML techniques that require no prior training, which will pioneer the monitoring of human footprint in the marine ecosystem.}

The research used Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite images to capture the intricate dynamics of LULC changes from 1990 to 2020. A quantitative approach was adopted, involving the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for enhanced classification accuracy. This methodology allowed for a detailed and precise identification of various LULC classes, revealing significant trends and transformations in the region's landscape. The spatial modeling incorporated in this study allowed exploration of both large-scale patterns and localized changes, providing insights into the drivers and consequences of LULC dynamics. The statistical analysis revealed a notable increase in urbanized areas, coupled with a decline in natural ecosystems such as forests and wetlands. These changes reflect the impact of sustained urban growth and agricultural expansion, underscoring the need for informed land management and conservation strategies.

abstract = {Automated acoustic recorders can collect long-term soundscape data containing species-specific signals in remote environments. Ecologists have increasingly used them for studying diverse fauna around the globe. Deep learning methods have gained recent attention for automating the process of species identification in soundscape recordings. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-species multi-label classification of soundscape recordings, starting from raw, unlabeled audio. Training data for species-specific signals are collected using a semi-automated procedure consisting of an efficient template-based signal detection algorithm and a graphical user interface for rapid detection validation. A CNN is then trained based on mel-spectrograms of sound to predict the set of species present in a recording. Transfer learning of a pre-trained model is employed to reduce the necessary training data and time. Furthermore, we define a loss function that allows for using true and false template-based detections to train a multi-class multi-label audio classifier. This approach leverages relevant absence (negative) information in training, and reduces the effort in creating multi-label training data by allowing weak labels. We evaluated the pipeline using a set of soundscape recordings collected across 749 sites in Puerto Rico. A CNN model was trained to identify 24 regional species of birds and frogs. The semi-automated training data collection process greatly reduced the manual effort required for training. The model was evaluated on an excluded set of 1000 randomly sampled 1-min soundscapes from 17 sites in the El Yunque National Forest. The test recordings contained an average of ~3 present target species per recording, and a maximum of 8. The test set also showed a large class imbalance with most species being present in less than 5% of recordings, and others present in >25%. The model achieved a mean-average-precision of 0.893 across the 24 species. Across all predictions, the total average-precision was 0.975.}

abstract = {In recent years, ecoacoustics has offered an alternative to traditional biodiversity monitoring techniques with the development of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems allowing, among others, to detect and identify species that are difficult to detect by human observers, automatically. PAM systems typically generate large audio datasets, but using these monitoring techniques to infer ecologically meaningful information remains challenging. In most cases, several thousand hours of recordings need to be manually labeled by experts limiting the operability of the systems. Based on recent developments of meta-learning algorithms and unsupervised learning techniques, we propose here Meta-Embedded Clustering (MEC), a new method with high potential for improving clustering quality in unlabeled bird sound datasets. MEC method is organized in two main steps, with: (a) fine-tuning of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with different meta-learning algorithms using pseudo-labeled data, and (b) clustering of manually-labeled bird sounds in the latent space based on vector embeddings extracted from the fine-tuned CNN. The MEC method significantly enhanced average clustering performance from less than 1% to more than 80%, greatly outperforming the traditional approach of relying solely on CNN features extracted from a general neotropical audio database. However, this enhanced performance came with the cost of excluding a portion of the data categorized as noise. By improving the quality of clustering in unlabeled bird sound datasets, the MEC method should facilitate the work of ecoacousticians in managing acoustic units of bird song/call clustered according to their similarities, and in identifying potential clusters of species undetected using traditional approaches.}

abstract = {Progress in deep learning, more specifically in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the creation of classification models, has been tremendous in recent years. Within bioacoustics research, there has been a large number of recent studies that use CNNs. Designing CNN architectures from scratch is non-trivial and requires knowledge of machine learning. Furthermore, hyper-parameter tuning associated with CNNs is extremely time consuming and requires expensive hardware. In this paper we assess whether it is possible to build good bioacoustic classifiers by adapting and re-using existing CNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset – instead of designing them from scratch, a strategy known as transfer learning that has proved highly successful in other domains. This study is a first attempt to conduct a large-scale investigation on how transfer learning can be used for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), to simplify the implementation of CNNs and the design decisions when creating them, and to remove time consuming hyper-parameter tuning phases. We compare 12 modern CNN architectures across 4 passive acoustic datasets that target calls of the Hainan gibbon Nomascus hainanus, the critically endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata, the vulnerable Thyolo alethe Chamaetylas choloensis, and the Pin-tailed whydah Vidua macroura. We focus our work on data scarcity issues by training PAM binary classification models very small datasets, with as few as 25 verified examples. Our findings reveal that transfer learning can result in up to 82% F1 score while keeping CNN implementation details to a minimum, thus rendering this approach accessible, easier to design, and speeding up further vocalisation annotations to create PAM robust models.}

Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters used for estimating animal locations and tri-axial accelerometers used for measuring the 3-dimensional accelerations of animal's motion aid researchers in collecting location and locomotion data at fine spatial and temporal scales. Machine learning and other advanced statistical methods bridge conceptual models to data, providing insights into ecological and physiological mechanisms underlying animal behavior and movements. This study reviews the general principles and applications of state space models, hidden Markov models, random forests, and support vector machines in the inference of animal behavior from movement data. Unsupervised learning algorithms, including Bayesian state space models implemented for robust correlated random walk models and hidden Markov models, help infer different behavioral modes using GPS location data. State space models can account for measurement error in GPS locations and estimate the true locations of animals; however, without including movement-state switching, state space models do not infer behavioral modes directly. On the contrary, hidden Markov models estimate the probabilities that animals switch between different behavioral modes. Nevertheless, hidden Markov models neither directly estimate animal locations nor account for measurement error explicitly. Supervised learning algorithms integrate data on locations and directional accelerations with synchronized behavioral observations (i.e., labels) to classify behaviors to pre-defined behavioral categories. Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning requires behavioral observations to label locations and accelerometer data to train the learning algorithms. However, behavioral observations synchronized with relocations and acceleration records are often missing or unattainable in many species, hindering the applications of supervised learning, making unsupervised learning a suitable tool for behavioral annotation of movement paths in secretive (cryptic) or less studied species. Environmental and behavioral annotations of animal movement paths by machine learning improve understanding the effects of environmental conditions on animal movements and behavioral decisions.}

However, the application of these methods on the rapid identification of tiny congeneric species moving across heterogeneous background remains difficult. To improve rapid and automatic identification in the field, we customized an existing CNN-based method for a field video involving two Phyllotreta beetles. We first performed data augmentation using transformations, syntheses, and random erasing of the original images. We then proposed a two-stage method for the detection and identification of small insects based on CNN, where YOLOv4 and EfficientNet were used as a detector and a classifier, respectively. Evaluation of the model revealed that one-step object detection by YOLOv4 alone was not precise (Precision=0.55) when classifying two species of flea beetles and background objects. In contrast, the two-step CNNs improved the precision (Precision=0.89) with moderate accuracy (F-measure=0.55) and acceptable speed (ca. 5 frames per second for full HD images) of detection and identification of insect species in the field. Although real-time identification of tiny insects remains a challenge in the field, our method aids in improving small object detection on a heterogeneous background.}

In total, 723 min of acoustic data were annotated for the presence of whistles, burst pulses and echolocation clicks produced by Delphinus delphis (~45.6%), Tursiops aduncus (~39%), Sousa plumbea (~14.4%), Orcinus orca (~1%).

The best detection model was built using a customised architecture and achieved an accuracy of 84.4% for all dolphin vocalisations on the test set, and 89.5% for vocalisations with a high signal to noise ratio. The best identification model was also built using the customised architecture and correctly identified S. plumbea (96.9%), T. aduncus (100%), and D. delphis (78%) encounters in the testing dataset.

However, accurate measurement of water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll a (CHL-a), water clarity (Secchi depth; SD), and total suspended solids (TSS), in inland waters is challenging due to the optical complexity of individual water bodies, which impedes the optimization of conventional bio-optical algorithms. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the viability of harmonizing Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery surface reflectance (SR) products to facilitate the monitoring of inland reservoir CHL-a, SD, and TSS using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and machine learning algorithms. Machine learning models were trained using Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance products to identify bands and combinations predicting CHL-a, SD, and TSS. Among the machine learning algorithms tested, random forest (RF) (S-2 MSI: R2 = 0.61, mean absolute error [MAE] = 6.56%, root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 12.51 μg/L, L-8 OLI: R2 = 0.56, MAE = 8.44%, RMSE = 16.01 μg/L) yielded the best results in the test set for CHL-a prediction from the Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI, outperforming the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. It also showed superior performance for SD and TSS prediction. The feature importance analysis revealed that specific band ratios, such as (red/red edge1)*red edge2 for Sentinel-2 MSI and red/blue for Landsat-8 OLI, were significant predictors of CHL-a and TSS. The red/blue band ratio and the green band were highly predictive for SD in Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI, respectively. The results of fall CHL-a predictions revealed varying trophic levels in the reservoirs. Landsat-8 OLI indicated that 2% of the reservoirs were oligotrophic, while 46%, 43%, and 9% were mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypertrophic, respectively. Meanwhile, the Sentinel-2 MSI results showed that 51% of the reservoirs were mesotrophic, while 6%, 35%, and 8% were oligotrophic, eutrophic, and hypertrophic, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance products in estimating and monitoring reservoir water quality parameters using machine learning algorithms. This approach has the potential to yield valuable insights aiding the assessment and management of water quality at the regional, national, and global levels.}

abstract = {Changes in climate can greatly affect the phenology of plants, which can have important feedback effects, such as altering the carbon cycle. These phenological feedback effects are often induced by a shift in the start or end dates of the growing season of plants. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) serves as a straightforward indicator for assessing the presence of green vegetation and can also provide an estimation of the plants' growing season. In this study, we investigated the effect of soil temperature on the timing of the start of the season (SOS), timing of the peak of the season (POS), and the maximum annual NDVI value (PEAK) in subarctic grassland ecosystems between 2014 and 2019. We also explored the impact of other meteorological variables, including air temperature, precipitation, and irradiance, on the inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology. Using machine learning (ML) techniques and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, we analyzed the relative importance and contribution of each variable to the phenological predictions. Our results reveal a significant relationship between soil temperature and SOS and POS, indicating that higher soil temperatures lead to an earlier start and peak of the growing season. However, the Peak NDVI values showed just a slight increase with higher soil temperatures. The analysis of other meteorological variables demonstrated their impacts on the inter-annual variation of the vegetation phenology. Ultimately, this study contributes to our knowledge of the relationships between soil temperature, meteorological variables, and vegetation phenology, providing valuable insights for predicting vegetation phenology characteristics and managing subarctic grasslands in the face of climate change. Additionally, this work provides a solid foundation for future ML-based vegetation phenology studies.}

DialectDecoder is an example of humans and computers working together to detect and classify anomalies. After preprocessing the data and training the classifiers with the built-in tools, each new song is fed to the network where the computer classifies the song as a specific dialect or gives the song conflicting labels which, with the song, are sent to the expert human for classification. The human expert can label all songs with conflicting labels and append them to the training set, which provides the computer with updated information to retrain on. We performed three different tests that illustrate the applicability of human-machine teaming and demonstrate the ability of DialectDecoder, paired with an expert human, to classify different dialects of White-crowned Sparrow songs. Then, we discuss extensions of DialectDecoder and its applicability to other human-machine teaming tasks that leverage the distinct strengths contributed by each half of the partnership to improve overall performance.}

abstract = {The importance of water quality models has increased as their inputs are critical to the development of risk assessment framework for environmental management and monitoring of rivers. However, with the advent of a plethora of recent advances in ML algorithms better predictions are possible. This study proposes a causal and effect model by considering climatological such as temperature and precipitation along with geospatial information related to the agricultural land use factor (ALUF), the forest land use factor (FLUF), the grassland usage factor (GLUF), the shrub land use factor (SLUF), and the urban land use factor (ULUF). All these factors are included in the input data, whereas four Stream Water Quality parameters (SWQPs) such as Electrical Conductivity (EC), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Nitrate, and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) from 2019 to 2021 are taken as outputs to predict the Godavari River Basin water quality. In the preliminary investigation, out of these four SWQPs, nitrate's coefficient of variation (CV) is high, revealing a close association with climate parameters and land use practices across the sampling stations. In the authors' earlier study, a model using a single-layer Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) showed improved performance in predicting cause and effect factors linked to water quality metrics. To achieve better prediction, a stacked ANN meta-model and nine conventional machine learning (ML) models, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Extra Trees (ET), Bagging (BG), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost or Adaptive Boosting (ADB), Decision Tree (DT), Highest Gradient Boosting (HGB), Light Gradient Boosting Method (LGBM), and Gradient Boosting (GB), were compared in this study. According to the study's findings, Bagging and Boosting models outperformed stand-alone earlier FFNN for the same dataset and showed superior predictive capabilities in terms of accuracy in forecasting the variable of interest. For instance, during testing, the coefficient of determination (R2) of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) increased from 0.72 to 0.87. Furthermore, a stacked Artificial Neural Network (ANN) meta model that was reinforced using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Extra Trees (ET) as base models performed better than the individual ML models (from R2 = 0.87 to 0.91 for BOD in testing). By using this new framework, the effort for hyperparameter tuning can be minimized.}

Building upon this hypothesis, the study introduces Wind2TSM-Net, a machine learning model that effectively bridges between different regression and neural network algorithms. This model connects on-site wind speed measurements with TSM data obtained through a physically remote sensing approach. It accurately predicts TSM concentration values, overcoming challenges such as cloud interference and reducing reliance on satellite imagery. The model was applied to Iran's Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs (CNRs) as a case study in an arid and remote area. The results revealed a significant correlation between TSM concentration and wind speed measurements, with impressive performance metrics (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.97 g/m3, mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.33). These findings highlight the effectiveness of Wind2TSM-Net in monitoring TSM values in remote and dry regions, particularly during extreme weather conditions when on-site measurements are impractical or cloud cover obstructs satellite observations.}

abstract = {Remote sensing can be a valuable alternative or complement to traditional techniques for monitoring wildlife populations, but often entails operational bottlenecks at the image analysis stage. For example, photographic aerial surveys have several advantages over surveys employing airborne observers or other more intrusive monitoring techniques, but produce onerous amounts of imagery for manual analysis when conducted across vast areas, such as the Arctic. Deep learning algorithms, chiefly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise for automatically detecting wildlife in large and/or complex image sets. But for sparsely distributed species, such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus), there may not be sufficient known instances of the animals in an image set to train a CNN. We investigated the feasibility of instead providing ‘synthesized’ training data to a CNN to detect polar bears throughout large volumes of aerial imagery from a survey of the Baffin Bay subpopulation. We harvested 534 miscellaneous images of polar bears from the Web that we edited to more closely resemble 21 known images of bears from the aerial survey that were solely used for validation. We combined the Web images of polar bears with 6292 random background images from the aerial survey to train a CNN (ResNet-50), which subsequently correctly classified 20/21 (95%) bear images from the survey and 1172/1179 (99.4%) random background validation images. Given that even a small background misclassification rate could produce multitudinous false positives over many thousands of photos, we describe a potential workflow to efficiently screen out erroneous detections. We also discuss potential avenues to improve CNN accuracy, and the broader applicability of our approach to other image-based wildlife monitoring scenarios. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using miscellaneously sourced images of animals to train deep neural networks for specific wildlife detection tasks.}

Embeddings are the output of the penultimate layer of a DNN, an N-dimensional vector that, only one step removed from the final output, represent the inner-workings of a DNN model. Using existing dimensionality reduction techniques we converted the N-dimensional embeddings into 2 or 3-dimensional arrays displayed in scatterplots. By incorporating sound samples into the scatterplots we developed a visual and aural interactive interface and demonstrate its utility in assessing the performance of trained bioacoustic models, facilitating post-processing of results, error detection, input selection and the detection of rare events, which the reader can experience in online examples with publicly available code.}

abstract = {As agricultural land expansion is the primary driver of deforestation, agroforestry could be an optimal land use strategy for climate change mitigation and reducing pressure on forests. Agroforestry is a promising method for carbon sequestration. With recent advancements in geospatial and data science technology, the ability to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) and assess ecosystem services in agroforestry is rapidly expanding. This study was conducted in the Belpada Block of Balangir, Odisha, a forest-dominated region of eastern India. We recorded species occurrence and measured plant parameters, including Circumference at Breast Height (CBH), height, and geolocation, in 196 plots (0.09 ha) in agroforestry intervention sites and noted the tree species. This study used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 multi sensor data to achieve data synergy in AGB estimation. Three machine learning models were used: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The RF model exhibited the highest level of prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 17.07 Mg/ha), followed by the ANN model (R2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 19.35 Mg/ha), SVM model (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 21.97 Mg/ha. The spectral vegetation indices that are (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Modified Simple Ratio (MSR), Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), and SAR backscatter values, were found important variables for AGB prediction. The findings revealed that agroforestry interventions and plantations resulted in an average carbon stock increase of 15 Mg/ha over five years in the study area. The Plant Value Index (PVI), which indicates the importance of species in the local economy and biomass carbon storage, showed that Tectona grandis was the dominant species with the highest PVI value (88.35), followed by Eucalyptus globulus (56.87), Mangifera indica (53.75), and Azadirachta indica (15.45). This approach enables the expansion of monitoring efforts to assess carbon stock in agroforestry systems, thereby promoting effective management strategies.}

Tools designed for forecasting optimum tuna fishing grounds can contribute to adapting to changes in fish distribution due to climate change, by identifying the location of new suitable fishing grounds, and thus reducing the search time. While information about the high probability to find vulnerable species could result in a bycatch reduction. The present study aims at contributing to a more sustainable and cleaner fishing, i.e. catching the same amount of target tuna with less fuel consumption/emissions and lower bycatch. To achieve this, tropical tuna catches as target species, and silky shark accidental catches as bycatch species have been modelled by machine learning models in the Indian Ocean using as inputs historical catch data of these fleets and environmental data. The resulting models show an accuracy of 0.718 and 0.728 for the SKJ and YFT, being the absences (TPR = 0.996 for SKJ and 0.993 for YFT, respectively) better predicted than the high or low catches. In the case of the BET, which is not the main target species of this fleet, the accuracy is lower than that of the previous species. Regarding the silky shark, the presence/absence model provides an accuracy of 0.842. Even though the model's performance has room for improvement, the present work lays the foundations of a process for forecasting fishing grounds avoiding vulnerable species, by only using as input data forecast environmental data provided in near real time by earth observation programs. In the future these models can be improved as more input data and knowledge about the main environmental conditions influencing these species becomes available.}

abstract = {Fish are key members of marine ecosystems, and they have a significant share in the healthy human diet. Besides, fish abundance is an excellent indicator of water quality, as they have adapted to various levels of oxygen, turbidity, nutrients, and pH. To detect various fish in underwater videos, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be of great assistance. However, training DNNs is highly dependent on large, labeled datasets, while labeling fish in turbid underwater video frames is a laborious and time-consuming task, hindering the development of accurate and efficient models for fish detection. To address this problem, firstly, we have collected a dataset called FishInTurbidWater, which consists of a collection of video footage gathered from turbid waters, and quickly and weakly (i.e., giving higher priority to speed over accuracy) labeled them in a 4-times fast-forwarding software. Next, we designed and implemented a semi-supervised contrastive learning fish detection model that is self-supervised using unlabeled data, and then fine-tuned with a small fraction (20%) of our weakly labeled FishInTurbidWater data. At the next step, we trained, using our weakly labeled data, a novel weakly-supervised ensemble DNN with transfer learning from ImageNet. The results show that our semi-supervised contrastive model leads to more than 20 times faster turnaround time between dataset collection and result generation, with reasonably high accuracy (89%). At the same time, the proposed weakly-supervised ensemble model can detect fish in turbid waters with high (94%) accuracy, while still cutting the development time by a factor of four, compared to fully-supervised models trained on carefully labeled datasets. Our dataset and code are publicly available at the hyperlink FishInTurbidWater.}

So far, the usage of repeat photographs for quantitative analyses is limited to approaches based on manual classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection and classification of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. We also tested if the classification results based on the automatic approach can be used for quantifying changes in woody vegetation cover between image pairs. The CNN was trained with 50 × 50 pixel tiles of woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation. We then tested the classifier on 17 pairs of repeat photographs to assess the model performance on unseen data. Results show that the CNN performed well in differentiating woody vegetation from non-woody vegetation (accuracy = 87.7%), but accuracy varied strongly between individual images. The very similar appearance of woody vegetation and herbaceous species in photographs made this a much more challenging task compared to the classification of vegetation as a single class (accuracy = 95.2%). In this regard, image quality was identified as one important factor influencing classification accuracy. Although the automatic classification provided good individual results on most of the 34 test photographs, change statistics based on the automatic approach deviated from actual changes. Nevertheless, the automatic approach was capable of identifying clear trends in increasing or decreasing woody vegetation in repeat photographs. Generally, the use of repeat photography in landscape monitoring represents a significant added value to other quantitative data retrieved from remote sensing and field measurements. Moreover, these photographs are able to raise awareness on landscape change among policy makers and public as well as they provide clear feedback on the effects of land management.}

A method for the passive monitoring of diversity, activity and acoustic phenology of structural species of a bird community in an annual cycle is presented. The method includes the semi-automatic elaboration of a dataset of 22 vocal and instrumental forms of 16 species. To analyze bioacoustic richness, the UMAP algorithm was run on two parallel feature extraction channels. A convolutional neural network was trained using STFT-Mel spectrograms to perform the task of automatic identification of bird species. The predictive performance was evaluated by obtaining a minimum average precision of 0.79, a maximum equal to 1.0 and a mAP equal to 0.97. The model was applied to a huge set of passive recordings made in a network of urban wetlands for one year. The acoustic activity results were synchronized with climatological temperature data and sunlight hours. The results confirm that the proposed method allows for monitoring a taxonomically diverse group of birds that nourish the annual soundscape of an ecosystem, as well as detecting the presence of cryptic species that often go unnoticed.}

abstract = {The industrialization has been the primary cause of the economic boom in almost all countries. However, this happened at the cost of the environment, as industrialization also caused carbon emissions to increase exponentially. According to the established literature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is related to carbon emissions (CO2) which could be optimally employed to precisely estimate a country's GDP. However, the scarcity of data is a significant bottleneck that could be handled using transfer learning (TL) which uses previously learned information to resolve new tasks, more specifically, related tasks. Notably, TL is highly vulnerable to performance degradation due to the deficiency of suitable information and hesitancy in decision-making. Therefore, this paper proposes ‘Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL)’, which is trained to use CO2 emission data of developed nations and is tested for its prediction of GDP in a developing nation. IFTL exploits the concepts of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and a newly introduced function called the modified Hausdorff distance function. The proposed IFTL is investigated to demonstrate its actual capabilities for TL in modeling hesitancy. To further emphasize the role of hesitancy modelled with IFSs, we propose an ordinary fuzzy set (FS) based transfer learning. The prediction accuracy of the IFTL is further compared with widely used machine learning approaches, extreme learning machines, support vector regression, and generalized regression neural networks. It is observed that IFTL capably ensured significant improvements in the prediction accuracy over other existing approaches whenever training and testing data have huge data distribution differences. Moreover, the proposed IFTL is deterministic in nature and presents a novel way for mathematically computing the intuitionistic hesitation degree.}

abstract = {Cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) is a major threat to cotton production in Africa and South Asia. Due to the dearth of absolute CLCuD-resistant cultivars and effective Bemisia tabaci-vector management strategy, yield loss in cotton crops is witnessed regularly. To ensure the timely application of management practices there is a dire need for a reliable prediction model that can forecast the CLCuD with high speed and accuracy. To overcome this problem, we developed and compared the machine learning (ML) techniques- multiple linear regression (MLR), bootstrap forest (BSF), boosted tree (BST) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict CLCuD under field conditions. We investigated disease and weather data collected from four locations (host spots) for a period of nine years (2011–12 to 2019–20). During each season/year, 10 ecological variables including CLCuD disease incidence, severity data from ∼8000 plants on four cultivars (2000 each), and ecological factors at each location were recorded. Temperature data were transformed to growing degree days (GDD) and used for modeling as one of the most dependent factors. All data sets for training and validation sets were divided into the ratio of 75:25 for machine learning models. Results indicated that the BSF model was the best ML model with the highest R-squared value in terms of CLCuD prediction accuracy (R2training = 0.81 and R2validation = 0.64) for CLCuD prediction. ANN model with 14 hidden nodes achieved a slightly low R-squared value (R2training = 0.80 and R2validation = 0.79) having an architecture of (9:14:1) whereas, the BST model achieved the lowest R-squared value (R2training = 0.71 and R2validation = 0.59). The testing and validation of activation functions and various training and validation sets indicated that the BSF model is the best ML model. This can provide technical support for CLCuD prediction under field conditions through the designed graphical user interface and further advocate the timely application of management interventions to boost cotton productivity in the region.}

Overall classification accuracy ranged from 88% for the southwestern North Atlantic data to 97% for the northwestern North Atlantic. Results for many species could likely be improved with increased sample sizes, consideration of alternative automated detectors, and addition of relevant environmental features.

abstract = {Given the critical urgency to combat the escalating climate crisis and the continuous rise in agricultural carbon emissions (ACE) in China, accurately forecasting their future trends is crucial. This research employs the emission factor method to assess ACE throughout mainland China from 1993 to 2021. To refine our forecasting approach, both statistical and neural network methodologies were utilized to pinpoint key factors influencing ACE. We crafted forecasting models incorporating both deep learning techniques and traditional methods. Notably, the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator Bayesian Optimization (TPEBO) algorithm was applied to optimize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, culminating in the creation of a superior integrated TPEBO-LSTM model that demonstrated strong performance across various datasets. The forecasting outcomes suggest that ACE in 24 provinces are expected to reach their zenith before 2030, primarily driven by farm operations, as well as livestock and poultry manure management. The result provides a significant forecasting tool for assessing agricultural carbon emissions in different regions, offering insights crucial for targeted mitigation strategies.}

abstract = {The increasing availability of seabed images has created new opportunities and challenges for monitoring and better understanding the spatial distribution of fauna and substrata. To date, however, deep-sea substratum classification relies mostly on visual interpretation, which is costly, time-consuming, and prone to human bias or error. Motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks in learning semantically rich representations directly from images, this work investigates the application of state-of-the-art network architectures, originally employed in the classification of non-seabed images, for the task of hydrothermal vent substrata image classification. In assessing their potential, we conduct a study on the generalization, complementarity and human interpretability aspects of those architectures. Specifically, we independently trained deep learning models with the selected architectures using images obtained from three distinct sites within the Lucky-Strike vent field and assessed the models' performances on-site as well as off-site. To investigate complementarity, we evaluated a classification decision committee (CDC) built as an ensemble of networks in which individual predictions were fused through a majority voting scheme. The experimental results demonstrated the suitability of the deep learning models for deep-sea substratum classification, attaining accuracies reaching up to 80% in terms of F1-score. Finally, by further investigating the classification uncertainty computed from the set of individual predictions of the CDC, we describe a semiautomatic framework for human annotation, which prescribes visual inspection of only the images with high uncertainty. Overall, the results demonstrated that high accuracy values of over 90% F1-score can be obtained with the framework, with a small amount of human intervention.}

abstract = {Soil heat flux (SHF) is a key component of the surface energy balance and driver of soil physiochemical and biological processes. Accurate estimation of soil heat flux is challenging due to variations in soil composition, overlying vegetation density and phenology, and highly variable environmental forcings. Existing SHF process-based and data-driven estimation methods have focused on midday landscape scale estimates that correspond to satellite acquisitions, despite the high variability that SHF displays at diurnal scales and throughout the growing season. Recently developed data-driven techniques have emphasized pre-determined predictor variables, with model complexity and predictor selection not carefully evaluated, leaving a gap in our understanding of what information is required to accurately predict SHF. Here we developed and evaluated a suite of ensemble machine learning (ML) models to quantify the ability of meteorological and remote sensing data to predict SHF variability at half-hourly temporal resolution throughout a growing season, producing a comprehensive evaluation of the importance of predictor set composition for SHF estimation at high temporal resolution. We compared this suite of machine learning models to six semi-empirical models and found that the machine learning models broadly outperformed the existing models in capturing diurnal variability across the growing season for four agro-ecosystems (soybean, corn, sorghum, and miscanthus). Crop-specific ML models were able to capture over 86% of the variability in SHF using only two predictor variables, pointing to the need for careful evaluation of predictor sets to identify synergistic combinations. ML models developed using pooled data across all crops captured almost 80% of SHF variability using three predictors, demonstrating the power and generalizability of these methods independent of crop type. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to examine model interpretability, providing insights into the typically opaque ML modelling process and interaction of predictor variables. Models trained with fewer input variables tended to display more linear and interpretable feature attribution, motivating the use of interpretability as an important consideration in parsimonious model selection. These results provide a robust demonstration of the ability of ML to capture the variability in SHF at sub-hourly resolution across growing seasons spanning a wide range of phenological variation for unique agricultural systems. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of predictor requirements for model performance, guiding future applications that will take advantage of the next generation of satellite-based observing systems, or in-situ proximal observations of vegetation status and meteorological conditions.}

The machine learning methods were efficient. The Random Forest method showed superiority over the others for modeling growth in the Atlantic Forest. The Nemenyi test pointed out that the difference between the RF model and the other techniques was greater than the calculated Critical Difference (CD). Machine learning can be an important tool for modeling growth in forest fragments in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. They can help in understanding the biome and in developing management strategies aimed at recovering biodiversity and reducing the deleterious effects of fragmentation.}

To limit the socio-economic impact, it is essential to develop simple and fast numerical models that can predict these different cycles. Here, we aimed to improve the predictive performance and extracting relevant information from climatic events by applying the signature method to time series models. After transforming the data using this signature method, we performed a comparative analysis of the statistical and machine learning models. In addition, we used PDP (Partial Dependence Plot) and SPRC (Standard Partial Regression Coefficient) to better understand the interactions between different climate indices. Our results showed that the best predictive performance was obtained when we use the signature method with the LSTM (R2 = 0.74) and Lasso (R2 = 0.79) models. Two complementary methods were used to highlight the influence of the following climate indices on ENSO cycle changes: NINO3, NINO3.4 and NPI (North Pacific Index). These methodologies also enabled us to determine the switchover thresholds, and order temporal variations. With this first application of the signature method to this type of time series, we obtained accurate forecasts on a 6-month scale with reduced computation time. This suggests that our methodology can be applied to many other fields of research that use multivariate time-series analyses.}

This study upholded the efficacy of Sentinel-2 time series data in conjunction with ground data on aboveground biomass (AGB), ecological composition, and floristic composition for the development of a prediction model to determine AGB yield and species distribution in a semi-natural grassland. Two machine learning (ML) approaches, namely K-means clustering, and Random Forest (RF) classification were employed in a semi-natural grassland in Southern Europe. The study was subjected to a qualitative ground survey that identified two main groups. The first group (Cluster 1) was composed of nitrophilous species or nitrophilous species combined with xerophilous species and some hygrophilous species.The second group, on the other hand, consisted of only hygrophilous species or hygrophilous species associated with Ranunculus acris, Bromus hordeaceus, Brassica nigra, Lolium perenne and Trifolium sp. (Cluster 2). Using the above-mentioned algorithms, the study identified thetwo distinctive areas based on AGB estimates in the period beginning in March (vegetative growth) and extending to the first half of May. The R2 value for K-means classification was 0.59, with a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 1 t ha−1.The R2 value for the RF classification was 0.69, with an RMSE value of 0.59 t ha−1. The integration of ground-based data and ML classification techniques enables the generation of accurate, dynamic information on grassland, core attributes that play an integral role in sustainable ecosystem management and conservation.}

Deep artificial neural networks have revolutionized bird acoustic recognition; however, most methods overlook inherent relationships among bird populations, resulting in the loss of biological information. To address this limitation, we propose the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN), which incorporates hierarchical multilevel labels for each bird. PPNN uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels. Attention mechanisms are employed to extract and select common and distinguishing features, thereby improving classification accuracy. We also propose a path correction strategy to rectify inconsistent predictions. Experimental results on bird acoustic datasets demonstrate that PPNN outperforms current methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.450%, 91.883%, and 89.950% on the Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (100 species), BirdCLEF2018-Small (150 species), and BirdCLEF2018-Large (500 species) datasets respectively, with the lowest hierarchical distance of a mistake across all datasets. Our proposed method is applicable to any bird acoustic dataset and presents significant advantages as the number of categories increases.}

This study endeavours to offer a comprehensive global overview of recent advancements in modelling techniques within the realm of SDMs applied to cetaceans and sea turtles. Through a rigorous systematic review of 295 research papers, we identified gaps in species and geographic coverage and highlighted the underrepresentation of biotic, anthropogenic, and water column variables. Our examination revealed a diverse array of modelling approaches, showcasing a notable preference for standard regression-based or machine-learning models, such as GAMs or Maxent, with Bayesian-based models emerging and experiencing growing development. Critical limitations and decisions in constructing and evaluating SDMs were discussed, proposing best practices for future studies. Emphasis was placed on the importance of validating models using fully independent datasets, particularly in the context of conservationist studies. This work not only sheds light on the state of the field but also serves as a valuable tool for those interested in modelling the distribution of these magnificent and enigmatic animals, as well as other cryptic species, offering insights that can guide researchers in making informed decisions in the realm of SDMs.}

abstract = {Automating identification of benthic habitats from imagery, with Machine Learning (ML), is necessary to contribute efficiently and effectively to marine spatial planning. A promising method is to adapt pre-trained general convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to a new classification task (transfer learning). However, this is often inaccessible to a non-specialist, requiring large investments in computational resources and time (for user comprehension and model training). In this paper, we demonstrate a simpler transfer learning framework for classifying broad deep-sea benthic habitats. Specifically, we take an ‘off-the-shelf’ CNN (VGG16) and use it to extract features (pixel patterns) from benthic images (without further training). The default outputs of VGG16 are then fed in to a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a classical and simpler method than deep networks. For comparison, we also train the remaining classification layers of VGG16 using stochastic gradient descent. The discriminative power of these approaches is demonstrated on three benthic datasets (574–8353 images) from Norwegian waters; each using a unique imaging platform. Benthic habitats are broadly classified as Soft Substrate (sands, muds), Hard Substrate (gravels, cobbles and boulders) and Reef (Desmophyllum pertusum). We found that the relatively simplicity of the SVM classifier did not compromise performance. Results were competitive with the CNN classifier and consistently high, with test accuracy ranging from 0.87 to 0.95 (average = 0.9 (±0.04)) across datasets, somewhat increasing with dataset size. Impressively, these results were achieved 2.4–5× faster than CNN training and had significantly less dependency on high-specification hardware. Our suggested approach maximises conceptual and practical simplicity, representing a realistic baseline for novice users when approaching benthic habitat classification. This method has wide potential. It allows automated image grouping to aid annotation or further model selection, as well as screening of old-datasets. It is especially suited to offshore scenarios as it can provide quick, albeit crude, insights into habitat presence, allowing adaptation of sampling protocols in near real-time.}

abstract = {The species Pinus radiata is highly invasive in native forests in Chile, drastically affecting the functioning and structure of ecosystems. Hence, it is imperative to develop robust approaches to detect P. radiata invasions at different scales. Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have proven to be a promising alternative to detect plant invasions in high-resolution remote sensing data, such as those obtained by drones. However, studies have been limited in their spatial variability and their assessments of transferability or transfer learning to new sectors, hindering the ability to use these models in a real-world setting. We train models based on CNN architectures using unpiloted aerial vehicle data and evaluate their ability to transfer learning outside the training domain using regression approaches. We compared models trained with low spatial variability (mono-site) with those with high spatial variability (multi-site). We further sought to maximize the transference of learning outside the training domain by searching among different architectures and models, maximizing the evaluation in an independent data set. The results showed that transfer learning is better when multi-site models with higher spatial variability are used for training, obtaining a coefficient of determination R2 between 60% and 87%. On the contrary, mono-site models present a wide variability of performance attributed to the dissimilarity of information between sites, limiting the possibilities of using these models for extrapolations or model generalizations. We also obtained a significant difference between within-domain generalization using test data versus transfer learning outside the training domain, showing that testing data alone cannot depict such discrepancy without further data. Finally, the best models for transfer learning on new data domains often do not agree with those selected by the standard training/validation/testing scheme. Our findings pave the way for deeper discussions and further investigations into the limitations of CNN models when applied to high-resolution imagery.}

It has been used as a model organism for various analyses, including genetic functional analysis, individual behavioral analysis, and group behavioral analysis. Recently, it has also been studied as an important bioindicator of water pollution. In previous studies, traditional machine learning methods, such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), were used to determine water pollution and identify pollutants based on the differences in the swimming behavior of C. elegans before and after exposure to chemicals. However, these traditional machine learning models have low accuracy and a relatively high false-negative rate. This study proposes a method for detecting water pollution and identifying the types of pollutants using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a deep learning model suitable for time-series data analysis. The swimming activities of C. elegans in each of the image frames are characterized by the Branch Length Similarity (BLS) entropy profile. These BLS entropy profiles are converted into input vectors through additional preprocessing using two clustering methods. We conduct experiments using formaldehyde and benzene at 0.1 mg/L each, with observation time intervals varying from 30 to 180 s. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the previously proposed HMM approach and variants of LSTM models, such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM).}

Water quality evaluation is essential to develop remediation and management strategies. Computational tools such as machine learning based predictive models have been developed to improve monitoring network capabilities. The model's performance is reduced when datasets composed of reductant information are used for training, on the other hand, the selection of most representative and variable water quality scenarios could result in higher precision. This study analyzed historical water quality behavior in the Santiago River, Mexico, to identify the most variable and representative data available to train machine learning models (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System – ANFIS, Artificial Neural Network – ANN, and Support Vector Machine - SVM). Thirteen monitoring sites were clustered according to their water quality variability from 2009 to 2022. Subsequently, a Time Series Analysis (TSA) was used to select the most representative monitoring station from each cluster. Data for 6/13 monitoring sites were retained for the Best Training Subset (BTS) used to train restricted models that performed with similar (ANN and SMV) or higher (ANFIS) prediction accuracy (in terms of RMSE, MAE, MSE and R2) for both training and testing. This study provides evidence of water quality data containing redundant information that is not useful to improve machine learning model performance, in turn leading to overtraining. Combined analytical approaches can maximize the representativeness and variability of data selected for machine learning applications, leading to improved prediction.}

As such, it is necessary to establish a model for environmental research uses that can accurately predict soil Mn content over large areas. This study aims to develop a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model capable of accurately predicting Mn content in diverse soils based on visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy. A dataset containing 18,675 soil samples compiled from the Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey was used to train and adjust the model, following which the optimal model was applied globally. The correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and mean absolute error values for the optimal model on the test set were 0.76, 140.52, and 97.30, respectively. Feature importance analysis revealed crucial spectral bands at approximately 1400, 2200, 2300, and 2400–2500 nm, which enabled the Mn content to be estimated. The presence of these spectral bands indicates that clay minerals, H2O, and OH− groups had significant influence on Mn content. The MLP model developed can effectively identify regions with potentially high or low soil Mn content. With improvement of the spectral database, this model can provide effective assistance in evaluating soil Mn distribution at the global scale.}

abstract = {A data-driven approach to assess the occurrence of thermal stratification and the depth of the thermocline in water masses has been developed and tested in the Spanish reservoir of El Val. The novelty of this approach is that it relies only on readily available data that can be collected for almost any reservoir, providing water managers with a transferable tool that can be easily adapted for any other reservoirs or lakes. The input variables were meteorological data, the water level and the output flow. A non-supervised clustering technique, k-means, was used to identify the stratification period with unlabelled data, that is to say inferring patterns when data from the target variable is not available. As a supervised method, Artificial Neural Networks were used to classify a given day as having or not having stratification and, in the positive case, to infer the depth of the thermocline. The classification showed a very high accuracy (96%) and the estimation of the thermocline depth showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.94 m and 1.99 m in the training and test fractions, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to improve the explainability and they revealed that the most important features to infer the depth of the thermocline were the water level, the daily average solar irradiance and the air temperature.}

This study analyzed the viability of using nadir or downward photos from smartphones (iPhone 7) to provide quantitative ground cover and biomass loading estimates. Good correlations were found between field measured values and pixel counts from manually segmented photos delineating a pre-defined set of 10 discrete cover types. Although promising, segmenting photos manually was labor intensive and therefore costly. We explored the viability of using a trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to perform image segmentation automatically. The DCNN was able to segment nadir images with 95% accuracy when compared with manually delineated photos. To validate the flexibility and robustness of the automated image segmentation algorithm, we applied it to an independent dataset of nadir photographs captured at a different study site with similar surface vegetation characteristics to the training site with promising results.}

We propose the Pattern-Based Prediction (PBP) method for predicting population outbreaks. It uses information on previous time series values that precede an outbreak event as predictors of future outbreaks, which can be helpful when monitoring pest species. We illustrate the methodology using simulated datasets and an aphid time series obtained in wheat crops in Southern Brazil. We obtained an average test accuracy of 84.6% in the simulation studies implemented with stochastic models and 95.0% for predicting outbreaks using a time series of aphids in wheat crops in Southern Brazil. Our results show the PBP method's feasibility in predicting population outbreaks. We benchmarked our results against established state-of-the-art machine learning methods: Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory and Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates in most comparisons while providing interpretability rather than being a black-box method. It is an improvement over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use a quantitative approach for pest monitoring. We provide the implemented PBP method in Python through the pypbp package.}

That means specific recommendations are needed in order to apply ABA for forest biomass modelling in this region. The present study was directed to filling such gaps while examining the effect of input ABA parameters on AGB model quality in conditions of mixed mountainous forests in Central Europe. Specific objectives were to assess whether the strength of the AGB model can be impacted by 1) canopy conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), 2) airborne LiDAR point density (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 points/m2), 3) field methods to estimate AGB (with regeneration components or without), and 4) machine learning methods (AdaBoost, Random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression). The results show that canopy conditions and airborne LiDAR point densities did not affect the strength of the AGB model, but that model's strength was affected by the vegetation regeneration component in the field biomass reference and by the machine learning method tested for modelling. AdaBoost and random decision forest were the most successful methods. To evaluate the quality of an AGB model it is recommended to combine several individual evaluation functions into the model score. The study highlights several recommendations to follow when estimating AGB from ALS using an ABA in Central European forests.}

Using satellite imagery for Earth observation has become essential for monitoring land cover/land use (LCLU) changes and identifying critical areas for conserving biodiversity. Remote Sensing (RS) datasets are often quite large and require tremendous computing power to process. The emergence of cloud-based computing techniques presents a powerful avenue to overcome computing limitations by allowing machine-learning algorithms to process and analyze large RS datasets on the cloud. Our study aimed to classify LCLU for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five spectral indices to differentiate six land use classes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Optimization of the DNN model was conducted using a comparative analysis of three optimization algorithms: Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian optimization. Results indicated that the spectral indices improved classification between classes with similar reflectance. The Hyperband method had the best performance, improving the classification accuracy by 12.5% and achieving an overall accuracy of 94.5% with a kappa coefficient of 93.4%. The dropout regularization method prevented overfitting and mitigated over-activation of hidden nodes. Our initial results show that machine learning (ML) applications can be effective tools for improving natural resources management.}

abstract = {Water quality monitoring in inland lakes is crucial to ensuring the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. For regional water environment agencies and researchers, remote sensing offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional in-situ water sampling methods. In this study, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on AlexNet to represent the relationship between Sentinel-2 images and in situ water quality levels of Lake Dianchi from November 2020 to April 2023. The model incorporated an algal bloom extraction algorithm and utilized correlation analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and random forest (RF) method to establish connections between two environmental factors: water quality and meteorology, to the area of algal bloom (AAB). The findings revealed an improvement in Lake Dianchi's water quality, with Levels A (good water quality) and B (mildly polluted water quality) averaging 1.24% and 84.28%, respectively. Starting in October 2022, water quality stabilized at Level B, averaging at 98.17%. Seasonal variations demonstrated the best water quality in spring and the worst in summer (Level C, severely polluted water quality, accounting for 5.19% and 21.68%, respectively). Algal bloom presence was minimally observed, with an average AAB value of 1.75%, peaking in autumn (4.05%) and hitting a low in winter (0.38%). A significant correlation was identified between water quality levels and AAB, with a notable spatial trend of decreasing Level C water quality and AAB from north to south, featuring lower AAB in the Southern Waihai compared to the Central Waihai. Statistical analysis pinpointed total phosphorus (TP) as the dominant factor influencing AAB, while meteorological factors such as wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation (PP) playing secondary roles. Despite fluctuations in TP concentration, a recent stabilization at 0.05 mg/L suggests a positive trajectory for future algal bloom management in Lake Dianchi.}

Here, we introduce such a system based on Convolutional Neural Networks for automatically predicting the species-wise plant cover. The system is trained on freely available image data of herbaceous plant species from web sources and plant cover estimates done by experts. With a novel extension of our original approach, the system can even be applied directly to vegetation images without requiring such cover estimates. Our extended approach, not utilizing dedicated training data, performs similarly to humans concerning the relative species abundances in the vegetation relevées. When trained on dedicated training annotations, it reflects the original estimates more closely than (independent) human experts, who manually analyzed the same sites. Our method is, with little adaptation, usable in novel domains and could be used to analyze plant community dynamics and responses of different plant species to environmental changes.}

The maturity status in fish is usually assigned by traditional methods such as macroscopy and histology. Macroscopic analysis is the assessing of maturity stages by naked eye and usually introduces large amount of error. In contrast, histology is the most accurate method for maturity staging but is expensive and unavailable for many stocks worldwide. Here, we use the Random Forest (RF) machine learning method for classification of reproductive condition in fish, using the extensive data from Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi gayi). Gonads randomly collected from commercial industrial and acoustic surveys were classified as immature, mature-active and mature-inactive. A classifier for these three maturity classes was fitted using RFs, with the continuous covariates total length (TL), gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (Krel), latitude, longitude, and depth, along with month as a factor variable. The RF model showed high accuracy (>82%) and high proportion of agreement (>71%) compared to histology, with an OOB error rate lower than 15%. GSI and TL were the most important variables for predicting the reproductive condition in Chilean hake, and to lesser extent, depth when using survey data. The application of the RF shows a promising tool for assigning maturity stages in fishes when covariates are available, and also to improve the accuracy of maturity classification when only macroscopic staging is available.}

Our results show that the current use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) to collect images of areas with shag colonies, combined with machine learning algorithms, can provide reliable and fast estimates of shag nest counts (F1 score > 0.95). By using data from only two shag colonies for training, we show that models can be obtained that generalise well to images of both spatially and temporally distinct colonies. The proposed practical application opens the possibility of using aerial imagery to perform large-scale surveys of Antarctic islands in search of undiscovered shag colonies.

This relationship can be investigated by analyzing avian vocalizations, which are robust indicators of trends in biodiversity. Within this contribution, we explored various data augmentation techniques and deep learning strategies for the classification of birdsong within natural soundscapes. For this purpose, we employed three fundamental deep neural network architectures, such as vision transformers, to classify 397 different bird species. To improve both the accuracy and generalizability of our models, we incorporated up to 19 well-established data augmentation techniques commonly used in audio classification. This included an iterative selection process where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were selected. The primary augmentation technique involved the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements, which significantly improved model performance as assessed on the BirdCLEF 2021 data set. Individual augmentations achieved F1-scores from 48.0 % (vertical flip) to 72.6 % (primary background noise soundscapes). Through the strategic combination of key techniques – namely simulated pink noise, interspecies sound mixing, and loudness normalization – we achieved a top F1-score of 73.7%. Depending on the selected classification model, this corresponds to an improvement by 4.81 % to 10.5 %. Improvements and deteriorations of all applied augmentation techniques appeared to be robust across our three evaluated models. Therefore, our approach highlights the potential of sophisticated audio augmentations in refining the accuracy and robustness of birdsong classification models.}

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation under increased urbanisation, industrial agriculture and land clearing, are changing the way insects occupy habitat. Some species are highly adaptable and may occupy urbanised areas, utilising anthropogenic microhabitat-scale features. Other species are dependent on natural elements of their habitats, having to locate small regions of natural microhabitat within increasingly hostile landscapes. Consequently, humans are encountering insects in new settings. Identifying and analysing insects’ use of natural and anthropogenic microhabitats is therefore important to assess their responses to a changing environment, for instance to improve pollination or manage invasive pests. But such studies are labour-intensive. Traditional studies of insect microhabitat use can now be supplemented by machine learning-based insect image analysis. Typically, research has focused on automatic insect classification, but valuable data appearing in image backgrounds has been ignored. In this research, we analysed the backgrounds of insect images available in the Atlas of Living Australia database to determine the microhabitats in which they were commonly photographed. We analysed the image backgrounds of three globally distributed insect species that are common across Australia: Drone flies (Eristalis tenax), European honey bees (Apis mellifera), and European wasps (Vespula germanica). Image backgrounds were classified broadly as either natural or anthropogenic using computer vision and machine learning tools benchmarked against a manual classification algorithm. Our automated image background classification achieved 97.4% accuracy when compared against manual classification. Mis-classifications were scarce, usually less than 1%, and primarily for backgrounds of wood and soil or bare ground. Our results indicate that drone flies and European honey bees were predominantly photographed against natural backgrounds (flies manual classifier 95±3%, automated classifier 94%, bees 89±2%,87%), implying frequent observations by humans in natural microhabitat. European wasps were less frequently photographed against natural backgrounds (70±6%,63%). Within this data set, observations of the wasps in anthropogenic microhabitats were more common than for flies and bees. Our results are aligned with the expectation that the wasps are relatively well-suited to urban environments, and that European honey bees and drone flies utilise natural features of their environment. In general, although biases in data collected without formal protocols limits their application, our new automated approach for image background analysis can provide valuable data about insects’ interactions with humans, our artefacts, and natural features of their environments.}

To address these issues, this study had combined fish posture recognition (using deep learning technology) with biomass estimation (utilizing stereo vision technology) for the first time, and developed a fast, precise, and fully automatic fish biomass estimation system. The improved single-stage target detection algorithm significantly improved the direct detection and extraction of high-quality images of moving fish in real-time, eliminating the need for manual processing of images that may have imperfect posture. Fish body length and height were measured in the real world using binocular stereo vision technology. Finally, the fish body weight can be estimated by considering the relationship among their body length, height, and weight. The experiment confirmed that the system had successfully avoided influencing factors that could affect fully automatic estimation. The results demonstrated a strong linear relationship between the estimated and measured fish body weights, with a mean relative error (MRE) of 2.87%. There were no significant differences between the estimated and measured weights (p = 0.94). The MRE of the multi-factor model was much lower than that of the single-factor model (length-weight of 8.86% and height-weight of 7.41%). The results indicate that the system developed is a highly effective approach to fully automated biomass estimation. This can be used to guide actual production and further study of the mechanism of fish growth.}

Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies are employed to analyze web text data and determine the average sentiment index for traditional villages in Fuzhou, China. Additionally, data on the built environment were acquired through the HRnet segmentation model and Matlab. To assess the association between environmental indicators and the sentiment index, we used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) model, and ArcMap software. The study demonstrated that (1) the spatial distribution of the average sentiment index was significant. Houfu Village (9.91), Qianhu Village (9.88), and Ximen Village (9.75) had the highest scores, while Doukui Village (−0.85), Jiji Village (0.2), and Qiaodong Village (0.55) had the lowest. (2) The indicators that have the most significant impact on sentiment are Openness, Greenness, and Color Complexity, with a contribution value above 0.7—followed by Enclosure, Visual Entropy, and Ground Exposure, with a contribution between 0.5 and 0.7. Furthermore, analyzing the interaction mechanism of the indicators showed a non-linear relationship. The environmental characteristics associated with high emotional index scores are openness in the range of 0.2 to 0.5, greenness in the range of 0.4 to 0.6, and color complexity in the range of 0.3 to 0.5. This study provides observations pertinent to the sustainable development of traditional village environments. The findings contribute to an understanding of how these environmental elements might be effectively designed to improve tourists' sentiment in rural settings.}

abstract = {Poisonous plants are the third largest category of poisons known globally, which pose a risk of poisoning and death to humans. Currently, the identification of medicinal and poisonous plants is done by humans using experimental methods, which are not accurate and are associated with many errors, and also the use of laboratory methods requires experts and this method is very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, distinguishing between medicinal and poisonous plants is very important using emerging, non-destructive, fast and accurate methods such as computer vision and artificial intelligence. In this study, we propose a robust and generalized model using spatial attention (SA) and channel attention (CA) modules for the classification of different plants. A dataset containing 900 confirmed images of three plant classes (oregano, poisonous and weed) was used. The attention mechanisms enhance efficiency of deep learning (DL) networks by allowing them to precisely focus on all relevant input elements. In order to enhance the performance of the proposed model, the CA was implemented based on four pooling operations including global average pooling-based CA (GAP-CA), mixed pooling-based CA (Mixed-CA), gated pooling-based CA (Gated-CA), and tree pooling-based CA (Tree-CA) operations. The results showed that the DL model based on Tree-CA had promising performance and outperformed other state-of-the-art models, achieving the values of 99.63%, 99.38%, 99.52%, 99.74%, and 99.42%, for accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score, respectively. The findings support our proposed attention model's success in identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. Recent advancements in computer-based technologies and artificial intelligence enable automatic detection of medicinal and poisonous plants, revolutionizing traditional identification methods.}

abstract = {Advancements in data availability, including high frequency, near real-time multiparameter sensors, laboratory analysis, and in-situ and remote observations, have driven the development of machine learning (ML) models for applications such as toxic Harmful Algal Bloom (HABs) monitoring. However, the performance of ML predictions is influenced by both model uncertainties due to inherent model structures and errors associated with input dataset measurements. For example, measurement uncertainty arises from sample collection, sensor drift and laboratory analysis and sample handling errors. While impacts of model uncertainty are commonly addressed using probabilistic approaches, the effect of measurement uncertainty is less studied due to the limited availability of detailed measurement information. This study focuses on assessing the impact of measurement uncertainty on the ML prediction of chlorophyll-a concentration as an index of HABs in a mesotrophic lake. Using randomized subsets of input measured datasets that mimic possible chlorophyll-a concentration distributions, the study built 1000 Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. An independent measured dataset was used to validate the ensemble models, allowing for model performance evaluation and the creation of prediction intervals to measure the propagated uncertainty. Our findings showed that the model predictions have MAE that ranged between 0.16 μg/l and 5.19 μg/l, and RMSE ranging between 0.20 μg/l and 7.39 μg/l. The highest uncertainty coverage of 0.71 was observed in the RF model without chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor. The study found that the training dataset sizes due to the high frequency and manually sampled nature influence how much measurement uncertainty is covered. The results of this study demonstrate how well ML models can capture various HABs patterns when given diverse measurement variables. Our findings will give researchers insightful information on how to lessen the impact of measurement uncertainty when using ML models as decision-support tools for HABs management.}

abstract = {The mosquito species is one of most important insect vectors of several diseases, namely, malaria, filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and so on. In particular, in recent years, as the number of people who enjoy outdoor activities in urban areas continues to increase, information about mosquito activity is in demand. Furthermore, mosquito activity prediction is crucial for managing the safety and the health of humans. However, the estimation of mosquito abundances frequently involves uncertainty because of high spatial and temporal variations, which hinders the accuracy of general mechanistic models of mosquito abundances. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a simpler and lighter mosquito abundance prediction model. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the artificial neural network (ANN), which is a popular empirical model, for mosquito abundance prediction. For comparison, we also developed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. Both the ANN and the MLR models were applied to estimate mosquito abundances in 2-year observations in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, conducted using the Digital Mosquito Monitoring System (DMS). As input variables, we used meteorological data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation. The results showed that performances of the ANN model and the MLR model are almost same in terms of R and root mean square error (RMSE). The ANN model was able to predict the high variability as compared to MLR. A sensitivity analysis of the ANN model showed that the relationships between input variables and mosquito abundances were well explained. In conclusion, ANNs have the potential to predict fluctuations in mosquito numbers (especially the extreme values), and can do so better than traditional statistical techniques. But, much more work needs to be conducted to assess meaningful time delays in environmental variables and mosquito numbers.}

abstract = {Commercial camera traps are usually triggered by a Passive Infra-Red (PIR) motion sensor necessitating a delay between triggering and the image being captured. This often seriously limits the ability to record images of small and fast moving animals. It also results in many “empty” images, e.g., owing to moving foliage against a background of different temperature. In this paper we detail a new triggering mechanism based solely on the camera sensor. This is intended for use by citizen scientists and for deployment on an affordable, compact, low-power Raspberry Pi computer (RPi). Our system introduces a video frame filtering pipeline consisting of movement and image-based processing. This makes use of Machine Learning (ML) feasible on a live camera stream on an RPi. We describe our free and open-source software implementation of the system; introduce a suitable ecology efficiency measure that mediates between specificity and recall; provide ground-truth for a video clip collection from camera traps; and evaluate the effectiveness of our system thoroughly. Overall, our video camera trap turns out to be robust and effective.}

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are a leading analytical technique used to monitor, map and quantify land use and land cover (LULC) and its change over time. Models such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) have been used effectively to classify LULC types at a range of geographical scales. However, ML models have not been widely applied in African tropical regions due to methodological challenges that arise from relying on the coarse-resolution satellite images available for these areas. In this study, we compared the performance of four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN and RF) applied to LULC monitoring within the Mayo Rey department, North Province, Cameroon. We used satellite data from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of northern Cameroon for November 2000 and November 2020. Our results showed that all four classification algorithms produced relatively high accuracy (overall classification accuracy >80%), with the RF model (> 90% classification accuracy) outperforming the kNN, SVM, and ANN models. We found that approximately 7% of all forested areas (dense forest and woody savanna) were converted to other land cover types between 2000 and 2020; this forest loss is particularly associated with an expansion of both croplands and built-up areas. Our study represents a novel application and comparison of statistical and ML approaches to LULC monitoring using coarse-resolution satellite images in an African tropical forest and savanna setting. The resulting land cover maps serve as an important baseline that will be useful to the Cameroon government for policy development, conservation planning, urban planning, and deforestation and agricultural monitoring.}
