abstract = {Soil forms the foundation for biotic and abiotic activities that shape landscapes over time. Effective communication and understanding of soil profiles, contents, and interactions with other systems such as vegetation and climate are crucial for multidisciplinary research and projects involving soil. A robust, comprehensible, and extendable visualization system is required to enhance communication across diverse disciplines, including landscape architecture, agronomy, and ecology. This paper introduces the BeingAliveLanguage, an innovative, extensible visualization system for soil-centric information within a multidisciplinary communication framework. The system employs a fractal-based visual language to effectively convey vital soil information to professionals in various fields engaged in architecture, landscape design, and urban planning projects. The corresponding software, developed as a plugin for the Rhino-Grasshopper CAD environment, allows users to automatically generate easily understandable soil-centered diagrams using a node-based programming language. Designed to enhance communication in landscape, geoscience, and agriculture-related fields, the system provides critical information to support the design and decision-making process. We showcase the system’s efficacy through two extensions and by utilizing the tool in multiple real-world projects.}

abstract = {To avoid wetland degradation and promote sustainable wetlands use, decision-makers and managing institutions need quantified and spatially explicit information on wetland ecosystem condition for policy development and wetland management. Remote sensing holds a significant potential for wetland mapping, inventorying, and monitoring. The Wetland Use Intensity (WUI) indicator, which is not specific to a particular crop and which requires little ancillary data, is based on the Mean Absolute Spectral Dynamics (MASD), which is a cumulative measure of reflectance change across a time series of optical satellite images. It is sensitive to the compound effects of land cover changes caused by different agricultural practices, flooding or burning. The more frequent and intrusive management practices are on the land cover, the stronger the WUI signal. WUI thus serves as a surrogate indicator to measure pressure on wetland ecosystems. We developed a new and automated approach for WUI calculation that is implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment. Its automatic calculation, use of regular Sentinel-2 derived time series, and automatic cloud and cloud shadow masking renders WUI applicable for wetland management and produces high quality results with minimal user requirements, even under cloudy conditions. For the first time, we quantitatively tested the capacity of WUI to contribute to wetland health assessment in Rwanda on the national and local scale. On the national scale, we analyzed the discriminative power of WUI between different wetland management categories. On the local scale, we evaluated the possible contribution of WUI to a wetland ecosystem health scoring system. The results suggest that the adapted WUI indicator is informative, does not overlap with existing indicators, and is applicable for wetland management. The possibility to measure use intensity reliably and consistently over time with satellite data is useful to stakeholders in wetland management and wetland health monitoring, and can complement established field-based wetland health assessment frameworks.}

Their predictive potential, entrusted to mathematical models, is of fundamental importance to set up opportune strategies to control pests and adversities that may occur and that may seriously compromise the natural equilibria. Among the others, population dynamics is one of the crucial challenges in the field. Despite the scientific community in recent years providing valuable models that faithfully represent terrestrial arthropods populations, such as insects, one of the main concerns is still represented by the parameter estimation. Parameters, in fact, characterise the species and their estimation are often entrusted to dedicated laboratory experiments that require specific equipment and highly qualified personnel. In this study we propose a novel method to estimate the model parameters directly from field data, where experimental activities are less expensive and less time consuming. In this study we propose a combination of least squares methods via genetic algorithms to preliminary evaluate the best parameter values and Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to obtain their distribution. The algorithm has been tested in the special case of Drosophila suzukii, to quantify part of the parameters of an almost validated model in two steps: i) a first pseudo-validation using perturbed numerical solutions, and ii) a validation using real field data. The results highlighted the potentialities of the algorithm in estimating model parameters and opened several perspectives for further improvements from both the computational and experimental point of view.}

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict has become a major challenge to conservation efforts around the world. Brown bears (Ursus arctos), which globally suffer from reduced habitat suitability and quality, frequently conflict with humans. These animals need large home ranges to fulfil their habitat requirements. When space and food are restricted, brown bears frequently shift towards human-dominated landscapes that offer reliable food sources. Türkiye, a country with predominantly human-dominated landscapes, experiences frequent human-brown bear conflicts (HBCs). However, there has been no formal analysis of the nature and scope of these conflicts at the country level. Using HBC data from 2017 to 2022, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of HBC events in Türkiye , constructing a risk map based on anthropogenic variables and geographic profiling to identify the driving forces. HBC events did not show any annual or seasonal trends but displayed considerable variation across biogeographic regions, with the highest incidence concentrated along the Black Sea coast and in Eastern Anatolia. Sixty percent of all conflicts were due to bear foraging behavior in or near human settlements while 12 % were the result of human activity in forests, with 57% of all conflict events resulting in direct injury to either humans or bears. Our analyses showed proximity to villages, protected areas, farmland, and the human footprint to be pivotal factors influencing conflict risk. Approximately 21% of the country's territory is susceptible to human-bear conflicts, with a substantial portion (43%) of these risks manifesting within a 10-km radius around protected areas. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the high occurrence of HBCs in Türkiye primarily stems from the limited availability of natural habitats and resources for brown bears, compounded by increased human encroachment in and around core bear habitats.}

These data can also be used in Species Distribution Models (SDM) to predict future spread or potential invasion of new areas. However, issues with non-equilibrium (also called disequilibrium) can cause difficulties in modelling invasive species that have not fully colonised their potential distribution and, in addition, sampling bias can result from a lack of information on survey effort, a particular issue for presence only modelling techniques. Geographical confounds are unavoidable when building iSDMs but there are methods that allow prediction to be optimised. We used maximum entropy (Maxent) to model suitable habitat for invasive Reeve's muntjac deer (Muntiacus reevesi) throughout Great Britain and Ireland comparing several methods that aimed to address invasive Species Distribution Modelling (iSDM) bias including spatial filtering, weighted background points and targeted background points built at varying spatial extents. Model evaluation metrics suggested that the model, which explicitly failed to account for non-equilibrium at the full extent of Great Britain and Ireland using random background points, predicted the species' current invasive range best. This highlighted that negative environmental relationships are likely to represent uncolonised areas rather than habitat selection and thus, low predicted suitability of uncolonised areas was misleading. Of the models that dealt with non-equilibrium conceptually best, by restricting the training extent to their current invasive range or core range, and utilised targeted background points accounting for survey effort (cells with other deer species recorded as present yet with no records for muntjac) as the best model evaluation metric, yielded relatively poor predictive performance. This implied limited habitat selectivity or avoidance within the colonised range which, when spatially extrapolated, suggested virtually all regions in Great Britain and Ireland may be vulnerable to future muntjac invasion.}

Fish is usually stored on ice to maintain its freshness. However, there has yet to be a standard for the fish freshness class during ice storage. On the other hand, each fish species has a different vigor in retaining freshness. In this research, we propose (1) a dataset of fish freshness inspection generated from daily inspection during ice storage for 11 days, (2) a standard of the freshness class of seven fish species using clustering, and (3) a framework for automatically determining the freshness class of fish with internal validation. The dataset is generated from daily inspection during ice storage for 11 days. Experts conduct the organoleptic inspection using six parameters according to the SNI 2729–2013 standards: eyes, gills, body surface mucus, meat, smell, and body textures. We experimented with six clustering methods on the dataset to obtain freshness clusters automatically. Our experimental results indicate that most species fall into two freshness categories, but Upeneus Moluccensis stands out by being classified into three distinct classes. Each species achieves a different number of days for each freshness class. K-Means and K-Means++ obtained the best freshness group with mean scores of 0.538 and 21.92 for Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz, respectively. Therefore, the standardization of fish freshness class during ice storage for 11 days achieved satisfactory results and was acceptable as guidance and standard in freshness examination.}

Improving fire danger assessment for these sensitive ecosystems is a core element of future-oriented fire management strategies in the face of climate change. While meteorological systems are common to predict fire danger in many countries, other factors such as vegetation, topography, lightning occurrence and human impact are generally not considered. We introduce an Integrated forest Fire Danger assessment System (IFDS) for the Alpine country Austria that includes i) daily fire weather index data, ii) a countrywide hazard map for fire ignition through human activities, iii) a lightning fire hazard map, iv) a high-resolution fuel type map, and v) a topography-based estimation of the fire hazard. The system was implemented as an online Web-GIS prototype. The objectives of this contribution are to describe the conceptual approach for the IFDS, to understand the predictive power of different data layers in fire danger rating and to identify potential improvements, especially regarding the role of vegetation and human influence. A first validation was done with 2018–2019 forest fire data. Some variants of the IFDS produced better overall prediction accuracy regarding forest fire ignitions compared to common fire weather indices. They typically performed relatively better when considering the number of false alerts as well. However, correlation between larger burned areas and higher index values was low. Conclusions for the implementation of the IFDS in other Alpine countries are discussed and recommendations for necessary and reliable datasets at high resolution are given.}

abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin is a global biodiversity hotspot, and oak tree species play an important role in it. Since the beginning of the Holocene (∼11.4 kyr BP), the distribution of forests has not occurred uniformly, resulting in diverse types of vegetation landscapes. In this study, we used a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to obtain the ecological niche model (ENM) of two sub-Mediterranean oak species, Quercus pubescens Willd. (pubescent oak) and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex (holm oak), both in the present day in the Iberian Peninsula and within a Middle Holocene (8.2–4.2 kyr BP) climatic scenario in the NE Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, we used the locations of Neolithic archaeological sites containing anthracological data to analyze the relationship between human occupations and oak habitats. Our results suggest that the two oaks have responded differently to the climatic conditions that have occurred, and show changes in both potential distributions. The palaeolandscape vegetation map shows a denser vegetation cover in the lowlands and a more open landscape in the highlands, with a higher dominance of Quercus pubescens in the septentrional areas, while Quercus ilex was more restricted to certain coastal areas. Temperature and precipitation factors, mainly seasonal climatic conditions, have had a greater impact on the distribution of vegetation than other factors. We found a good overlap between the ENM of the two oaks and the locations of the Neolithic sites analysed, and determined that the distribution of Neolithic archaeological sites is not random. The Neolithic populations in the study area depended heavily on the resources of the deciduous and evergreen sub- Mediterranean forest, although they also exploited the resources of the mountain pine forest. Neolithic sites distribution suggests that Neolithic human groups were aware of the potential of forests and probably gathered woody resources in their surroundings.}

The primary objectives of this study were to contribute to clarify the impact and the rationale of various land uses on the spatial variation of TSN and TSP in the corresponding soils. This study aimed to explore the relation of TSN and TSP distribution in NWH soils with various factors like landscape physiography and soil physical and chemical properties using random sampling and geostatistical analyses. Employing random sampling, 300 soil surface samples (at a depth of 0–20 cm) were collected across various 500 m × 500 m grids from agriculture, horticulture, forest and fallow lands in the NWH region. The spatial land heterogeneity of TSN and TSP were systematically analyzed using standard statistical and geostatistical approaches (Gaussian, spherical, exponential, and linear). Results revealed a decreasing order of TSN and TSP levels i.e., horticulture (0.410 and 0.723 mg/kg) > agriculture (0.314 and 0.597 mg/kg) > forest (0.236 and 0.572 mg/kg) > fallow (0.275 and 0.342 mg/kg). Stepwise multiple regression results demonstrated a correlation between TSN and soil organic carbon (SOC), while TSP was correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC) and fine-grained soil particles. Nugget % values indicated the following spatial variability for TSN: agricultural (1.4) > horticultural (3.2) > forest (3.9) > fallow land (4.8) > mixed land (5.8), whereas the spatial variability of TSP showed a similar trend for all land uses. The optimized conceptual framework and isotropy models varied for TSN and TSP on dependence on land use type. The results of this study revealed the spatial patterns and land use-related variations and improved the prediction of nutrient distribution, so contributing an optimized conceptual framework for future studies. Finally, this study provided crucial insights to enhance soil quality, fertility, agricultural sustainability, and environmental equilibrium in the ecologically fragile NWH region, contributing to solve a significant research gap in the global understanding of soil dynamics.}

In the first step of the study, using the ground- and satellite-based datasets, a new multiscale technique based on Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Differential Symbolic Entropy (DSE) was proposed to monitor the variations of drought in the selected region. In the next step, variations in the water level and salinity of Urmia Lake and its impacts on the environment were investigated using satellite datasets. Results showed that the Southern parts of the basin were more prone to severe droughts, and there was a direct relationship between entropy and drought intensity. Based on the results, it was concluded that climate change had an impact on the shrinkage of the lake; however, these changes were not solely responsible of causing the dramatic water loss of the Lake. Variations of the Salinity Index (SI) showed that saline lands were mostly seen in the Eastern and Southern parts of the lake, causing negative impacts on air quality and agricultural activities in these parts. It was found that the proper management of water resources would play an effective role in the restoration of the lake.}

Furthermore, global spatial autocorrelation, cold and hot spot analysis, and standard deviation ellipse analysis were used to investigate the spatial characteristics of carbon emissions at the street (township) level in Xi'an. This study revealed a sixfold increase in carbon emissions in Xi'an, rising from 51.35 million tons in 2000 to 281.95 million tons in 2021.The area affected by carbon emissions has expanded, with the centre of gravity of emission consistently shifting towards the south. The average street-level carbon emission density fluctuated and doubled compared to that in 2000. The total number of streets with low-carbon-emission-density decreased by 23%, indicating a shift away from low-carbon-emission-density streets. Furthermore, the global Moran's I index consistently remained within the range of 0.85–0.95, indicating significant spatial clustering, with cold spots expanding into surrounding districts and counties. Additionally, this study accurately identified carbon emissions within the city, offering the potential for the development of more precise carbon reduction strategies. Moreover, this approach can provide valuable support for the dynamic monitoring of carbon emissions in developing cities worldwide.}

We used the framework to analyze acoustic signals recorded continuously for over two years using autonomous recorders at various locations in Agmon Hula Lake Park, Israel. During this period there was an acute outbreak of avian influenza in the area. We analyzed differences in acoustic occupancy for various species between two consecutive years (November 2020 to October 2022). We examined between-year population trends for 17 species, both migratory and resident, and found a significant decline in vocal activity between the two years for 10 species.

Therefore, we propose a spatial modeling and quantification method based on nighttime light remote sensing to reflect human transmissibility and integrate this method with other variables to map the pest spreading risk. First, residential areas in China are extracted from annual NPP/VIIRS datasets. Then, the human transmissibility index is established based on GIS cost-distance analysis with impedance parameters related to geographical and land use features. Consequently, the propagation risk of the human-induced pest Hyphantria cuneas in China is assessed with a binary logistic model. The results show that the human transmissibility index obtained from nighttime light remote sensing images can be used to assess human accessibility in a continuous way in the field. When the Hyphantria cunea risk prediction index was adopted, the accuracy of pest range prediction improved by nearly 5% for occurrence and 3.3% overall, with a significant difference observed in a Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared with the effect of anthropogenic factors quantified considering basic geographic information and infrastructure features. In addition, all the model R2 values increased at different levels. The human transmissibility index can be used to effectively characterize the spatial pattern of human impacts and displays high accuracy in pest risk prediction. Understanding the human transmissibility mechanism of pests is important and provides a reference for achieving early warnings regarding pest spreading, performing potential host analyses for human infection caused by unknown pathogens, and modeling human ecological interference.}

It is compared to other sampling bias correction methods primarily used in the literature by analyzing their absolute and relative impacts on model performances. Results showed that the number of presence sites is critical for selecting the applicable method. The method proposed was regularly placed in the first or second rank and tends to be more proficient than other methods in the context of presence site scarcity (〈100).

The present study focused on Hainan Island (HN), China, from 2010 to 2020, using soil organic carbon (SOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) to create an assessment system (S→) for soil degradation based on change vector analysis. A geographical detector was used to determine the mechanism of soil degradation on HN. The total area of soil degradation in the study period was 673.69 km2, being concentrated in the northeast. Areas of soil degradation in forest, cultivated land, construction land, grassland, and unutilized land measured 439.88 km2, 184.06 km2, 25.44 km2, 22.56 km2, and 1.75 km2, respectively. The single factors of elevation (DEM), least distance to a point of interest in residential areas (LDP), and variation in mean annual temperature (VTem) were significantly correlated with soil degradation in cultivated land and grassland, forest, and construction land, respectively. However, paired factors exhibited greater explanatory power. The pairs of DEM∩LDR (DEM + least distance to point of interest of road and railroad, LDR), LDP∩LDR, and VTem∩VGDP (VTem + variation in GDP density) had the most significant correlations with soil degradation in cultivated land and grassland, forest, grassland, and construction land, respectively (p < 0.01). The soil resources of HN should be protected in multiple ways, such as by expanding ecological protection zones in high-altitude grasslands and forests. Moreover, urban development goals should be clearly defined to limit rapid increases in road and settlement construction to protect cultivated land and constructed land.}

In the Neotropical region, Myrteae is the main tribe of Myrtaceae and includes the most diverse genera Eugenia, Myrcia, Psidium, Myrceugenia, and Campomanesia. Here, we investigated the climatic suitability selected Myrteae species - Campomanesia guazumifolia, C. xanthocarpa, Eugenia pyriformis, and Psidium cattleyanum - across South America. This study spans the present day, three historical periods, and two future climate change scenarios. Our modeling analysis (ENSEMBLE) included environmental variables applied at the times evaluated. Our results suggest that temperature seasonality and precipitation in the driest month were the variables that most influenced climate suitability in the species. The Atlantic Forest lato sensu is a potentially climate suitable habitat for these four species over time, which matches the center of diversification and richness of Myrtaceae, in regions where they coexist and share habitats sympatrically. Historical glaciation events have influenced the retraction and expansion of species distribution, ultimately contributing to their current coexistence in select neotropical ecoregions. Our projections for the future indicate climate suitable habitats in areas similar to present models despite the different effects of climate change. The Atlantic Forest is the key to maintaining Myrteae biodiversity over time. Therefore, it is necessary to combine other approaches (e.g., evolutionary, ecological, and genetic studies) to deeply understand the evolutionary history of this region, its protection, and the maintenance of the biodiversity it harbors.}

Traditional fishway monitoring approaches, hindered by their inefficiency and substantial disruption of fish, are ill-suited for long-term surveillance; thus, employing video monitoring coupled with object detection technology presents an alternative or complementary solution. However, challenges such as the constrained computational capacity of onsite equipment in fishways, complexities involved in model deployment, and sluggish pace of detection are significant hurdles. In this study, by utilising the YOLOv8n model as a benchmark, we engineered a cross-stage partial module with a single convolution (C1) module to replace the existing C2f module with the aim of enhancing performance. We replaced the conventional 2D convolutions in the bottleneck configuration with depthwise separable convolutions and integrated the SimAM module to extract the detailed characteristics of the fish species. By amalgamating LigObNet detection with the DeepSORT algorithm, we established LigTraNet, which is designed to enable precise tracking, identification, and counting of individual fish. The results showed that LigObNet exhibited the lowest complexity and fastest detection speed for underwater fish among similar object recognition and detection models. Compared with the benchmark YOLOv8n model, there were reductions of 8.9% in the network layers, 40.5% in the parameter count, 39.3% in the memory footprint, and 35.8% in the giga floating-point operations and a 38.1% improvement in the inference speed. LigTraNet achieved a total count accuracy rate of 91.8%, demonstrating superior species quantification capabilities over other models with minimal resource usage and rapid inference capabilities, thus offering enhanced practicality for deployment on devices in real-world engineering contexts. This represents a departure from traditional manual monitoring methods for assessing fishway effectiveness, revolutionising aquatic ecological monitoring tools and methodologies and fostering the collaborative advancement of water resource project operations and ecological conservation.}

abstract = {In the Yangtze River Delta in China, known for its intricate water network, achieving harmonious development between humans and nature in rural areas is imperative. However, the identification of the water-net landscape characteristics and the relationship between rural sustainability and these landscape characteristics remain unclear. The aim of this study was to bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework for investigating the relationship between landscape characteristics and rural sustainability from a typo-morphological perspective. Specifically, through regression analysis, the influence of multilevel spatial characteristics of rural landscape on sustainability was selected as the research focus. First, multilevel metrics were introduced to delineate the rural landscape characteristics, including single and multiple landscape elements and landscape types, using deep learning methods to achieve automatic classification. Subsequently, by employing an improved entropy method, we comprehensively quantified rural sustainability indicators from the economic, social, and ecological dimensions. Finally, the ordinary least squares (OLS) model and two spatial variation coefficient models, namely, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), were used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between the landscape characteristics and rural sustainability. Significant regression model performances were obtained with adjusted R2 values of 0.33, 0.35, and 0.4 at each landscape characteristic level. The adjusted R2 values for the GWR and MGWR, which incorporated all of the landscape characteristics metrics, were 0.84 and 0.88, respectively. The results demonstrate that rural sustainability highly depends on the proposed multilevel characteristics and exhibits spatial heterogeneity. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the typo-morphological characteristics of the landscape and provide important planning and decision-making references for sustainable development in rural areas.}

abstract = {Topography modulates air and soil temperature and gives rise to local climates that may strongly deviate from regional macroclimates. These local climatic conditions determine the distribution of many organisms but are hardly accounted for by coarse-grained macroclimate grids. Downscaling macroclimate grids or interpolating high-resolution climate surfaces from weather station data has thus become a staple in ecological research. Against this background, topographically complex territories pose a challenge, as downscaling and interpolation techniques are susceptible to high topographic heterogeneity. Simultaneously, these regions will act as refugia and preserve biodiversity amidst the challenges of climate change. This contrast renders choosing the technique to derive local climatic conditions under high topographic complexity critically relevant. In this study, we compared how interpolation and downscaling techniques predict the local climates of topographically heterogeneous territories. We interpolated monthly average temperatures from weather stations in a Southern Italy mountain region and downscaled WorldClim and CHELSA macroclimatic grids from their native 30 arcsecs to 10 m resolution. We carried out the interpolation and downscaling procedures by employing four commonly used statistical algorithms and by including physiographic descriptors (altitude, northness, eastness, distance to the coast, and monthly average of daily clear-sky insolation time) known to determine local climatic conditions. We compared the techniques' predictive performance via leave-one-out cross-validation. We extended the comparison over the study area to identify where the techniques most strongly diverged and evaluated how interpolation and downscaling techniques fare against environmental extrapolation. Although the interpolations scored the best values across all error metrics, interpolating weather station data and downscaling WorldClim yielded essentially equivalent predictions of local climates in the cross-validations. Differences between the two techniques emerged during the spatial comparison, where downscaling WorldClim produced biased and less detailed monthly climate surfaces. On the contrary, weather station interpolation was affected by environmental extrapolation in the study area's most internal and topographically heterogeneous landscapes. Downscaling CHELSA severely over-smoothed local climatic conditions during both cross-validations and spatial comparisons, possibly due to lacking climate variability in the native product itself. We demonstrated that technique and data source choice affect the prediction of local climates in topographically heterogeneous territories. Despite its limitations, we argue that interpolating weather station data better accounted for local-scale topographic effects. These effects form an integral part of the microrefugia that will shelter mountain communities from warming climates. We thus recommend carefully considering the techniques chosen to unravel the intricate climatic mosaics of topographically heterogeneous territories.}

Collinearity of predictor variables is a concern limited to standard error of estimates for data models, although issues remain about identification of important variables and model transferability, whereas thinning of species occurrences is not likely to improve samples without information about species characteristics. Here, I present a case study of selection of correlated climate variables and thinning of species samples for distributions of 80 tree species in North America, modeled with random forests. Robust important variable identification and temporal transferability with correlated climate variables by random forests was displayed by 1) greatest accuracy with all 14 input predictor variables, at 0.99 sensitivity and 0.97 specificity, whether from current or future climate, compared to variable selection approaches to reduce correlation, 2) greater accuracy for two variable models from foremost ranked important variables than least important variables, 3) models with more than two fixed input variables agreed on the four most important variables, 4) models with all 14 input variables from current and future climates identified the same five most important variables, and 5) mapped models of current species observations were similar with use of current or future climates. Unconstrained distributions were apparent in mapped models with only one preselected temperature and precipitation variable. Thinning samples produced no clear benefits to unthinned samples. Following standard guidelines to remove correlated variables before modeling will result in information loss and may lead to incorrect omission of relevant variables, at least with random forests. Predictive modeling is a practical approach for informing variable selection, including retention of correlated climate variables, which create a reliable basis for accurate predictions.}

The method is characterized by weighting the log-likelihood equation to mitigate the impact of heterogeneous observations in the presence-only data, which can result from model misspecification.

For effective forest monitoring and management in the case of complex tropical Indian forests, there is a need to obtain reliable estimates of the amount of carbon sequestration at regional as well as national levels, but the estimation of biomass is quite challenging. The main objective of the study is to validate the usefulness of the gridded above ground biomass density (AGBD) estimates (ton/ha) of the spaceborne LiDAR Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation data (GEDI L4B, Version 2) across two tropical heterogeneous forests in India, Betul and Mudumalai forests. Methodology includes, for each forest area, a linear regression model which predicts AGB from Sentinel-2 MSI data was developed using ground reference data and comparing it with the GEDI AGBD values. The AGB model for the Betul forests in Central India had a RMSE of 13.9 ton/ha, relative RMSE = 8.7% and a R2 of 0.88, with a bias of −0.28 ton/ha, and a comparison between modelled AGB and GEDI gridded AGBD at 1 km resolution show a relatively strong correlation (0.66) and no or little bias. It also found that GEDI AGBD footprint value is underestimated compared to the AGB according to the Sentinel-2 model. For the Mudumalai forest in southern India, the AGB model had an RMSE of 29.1 ton/ha, relative RMSE = 10.8%, and an R2 of 0.79 and a bias of −0.022. The correlation between modelled AGB and gridded GEDI AGBD was 0.84, and GEDI AGBD is underestimated compared to AGB from the Sentinel-2 model. The field values of AGB of Betul lies between 42.2 ton/ha and 238.8 ton/ha and for the Mudumalai forests, the AGB lies between 75.9 ton/ha and 353.6 ton/ha. The results indicates that the GEDI gridded AGBD underestimates AGB, and that the model used to produce the gridded AGBD product needs to be adjusted to provide reliable information on the carbon balance and its changes over time for the type of Indian forests that exists in the two test areas.}

The management of stormwater runoff and nutrient pollution faces significant challenges due to inadequate assessment tools for evaluating nutrient loads across multiple watersheds at the state level and the absence of an open-source tool that can comprehensively assess the effectiveness of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) in nutrient removal while incorporating environmental justice (EJ) considerations. To address these challenges, we developed an innovative online statewide tool that identifies areas where BMP planning needs to be prioritized to address environmental disparities resulting from high pollutant loads intersecting with disadvantaged communities, alongside tracking pollutant loads after various BMP implementations. In doing so, we estimated pollutant loads including total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS) from urban land use in 1378 HUC-12 watersheds across Florida using EPA's pollutant load estimate tools (PLET), which calculates loads based on factors such as land use, septic systems and wastewater discharge, soil characteristics, and precipitation. To integrate BMP implementation with EJ considerations, a social vulnerability index was developed to identify tiers of sociodemographic disparities using racial/ethnicity metrics (e.g., % black, % Hispanic, etc.) and socioeconomic metrics (e.g., median household income, educational attainment, etc.). We then investigated the effectiveness of 28 urban stormwater BMPs in reducing pollutant loads and estimated post-BMP loads for each watershed. Hotspots of nutrient pollution were primarily identified in coastal areas, with residential land use as the main contributor. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Hillsborough counties had the highest sociodemographic disparities. In addition, central and southern Florida exhibited a disproportionate exposure of disadvantaged communities to pollutant loads. The developed online tool contributes significantly to holistic watershed management by features including visualizing the distribution of nutrient pollution loads across state watersheds, identifying areas with high pollutant loads intersecting with disadvantaged communities, and quantifying pollution load reductions post-BMP implementation. This research promotes equitable outcomes and empowers stakeholders in Florida to adopt sustainable and inclusive practices for water quality improvement.}

Predicting wildfire probability provides authorities with invaluable information to take preventive measures at the early stages. This study establishes Bayesian modelling for predicting the wildfire event probability based on a set of environmental predictors and forest vulnerability, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index. Prior information about the impact of these predictors on the likelihood of wildfire is available in the reports on the past major wildfire events. In that sense, the use of prior information in the Bayesian models has the potential to provide accurate predictions for the wildfire probability. Moreover, the relationship between the predictors creates mediating effects on the likelihood of a wildfire event. A multivariate prior distribution in the Bayesian modelling can capture the mediating effects. In this study, Bayesian models with informative and noninformative priors are considered with independent and multivariate prior distributions to utilize the available prior information and handle the mediating effects between the predictors using the normalized difference vegetation index data provided by Google Earth Engine. Nine years of data were gathered across 9841 sampled areas in a forested land of Australia. Modelling results concluded that forest vulnerability is found to be the dominant predictor of wildfire probability. This modelling can help create a Wildfire Warning Index based on climate data and forest vulnerability measurements, enabling preventative actions in high-risk and targeted areas.}

abstract = {Apex predator populations are in decline around the world. Many exist at low density and are elusive, making the acquisition of reliable data on their numbers and distribution a considerable challenge. The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is the largest of the five extant sub-species of tiger. The single most significant, contiguous population, an estimated 550 animals, exists in the Russian Far East, with smaller populations on the far eastern Sino-Russian border. For the last few decades, active efforts on the part of Chinese authorities have encouraged the recolonization of these populations back to their former ranges in Northeast China. Reliable data on Amur tiger numbers and distribution are required to assess population recovery at the landscape scale. Footprints, ubiquitous in the snow over range areas, could inform on these baseline data. This paper describes a statistically robust, cost-effective and non-invasive footprint identification technique (FIT) to identify individual tigers from footprints in snow. It is based on a rigorous data collection and data-processing protocol, combined with a cross-validated discriminant analysis method. A Ward's clustering technique provides a visual output of individual classification. The analytical tools are packaged in a user-friendly analytical interface. Between December 2011 and December 2012, we collected a series of 605 footprint images from 44 captive individual Amur tigers for a reference database from which to derive a classification algorithm. The 23 females and 21 males ranged in age from 3 to 13 years (female mean age 7.95 +/− 0.18; male mean age 8.08 +/− 0.19). 128 measurements (areas, lengths and angles) were taken from each print and analyzed with the FIT add-in to JMP software. The derived classification algorithm was then applied to 21 footprint trails collected from an unknown number of free-ranging Amur tigers during 2012 and 2015/2016. The algorithm predicted 7 Amur tigers at the site surveyed in 2012, and 4 tigers surveyed at two sites in 2015/16. We demonstrate that the footprint identification technique translates traditional tracking methodologies into a statistically robust and objective analytical tool that can be deployed by both scientists and local communities to monitor the recovery of big cat populations.}

However, the format of the data citation is still evolving, particularly with regards to citing dynamic data, subsets, and collections of data.

Providing easy-to-use data citations is a critical foundation that is required to address the socio-technical challenges around data integration. Studies that integrate data from dozens or hundreds of datasets must often include data citations in supplementary material due to page limits. However, citations in the supplementary material are not indexed, making it difficult to track citations and thus giving credit to the data producer. In this paper, we discuss our experiences and the challenges we have encountered with current citation guidance. We also review the relative merits of the currently available mechanisms designed to enable compact citation of collections of data, such as data collections, data papers, and dynamic data citations. We consider these options for three data producer scenarios: a domain-specific data collection, a data repository, and a large-scale, multidisciplinary project.

abstract = {Groundwater aquifers around the world are experiencing stress due to the composite influence of climate change and excessive groundwater withdrawal. Despite this influence, there is still insufficient knowledge on climate-groundwater interaction dynamics in complex aquifers like Australia's Great Artesian Basin. This understanding can inform improved management, which can in turn, increase resilience of groundwater system to on-going groundwater withdrawal and climate change. The main aim of this research was to assess the impacts of climatic change on groundwater storage (GWS) changes over the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) using a range of multi-scale indicators, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived groundwater observations and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices (SPEI). Rotated principal component analysis (rPCA) was used to identify climatic hotspots (where GWS variation is particularly sensitive or vulnerable to the impacts of climate change), and correlation analyses were used to assess the relationship between these hotspots and changes in groundwater over space and time. The localized spatial pattern via rPCA was uncovered in the GAB's southeastern region, where annual variations in GWS exhibited conspicuous peaks in 2002, 2014, and 2015. Another finding was that the southeast region of the GAB experienced higher GWS variations as compared to other sub-basins during 2007–2008, which resulted in low groundwater recharge. These findings underscore the variations in GWS within the GAB, emphasizing its responsiveness to climatic variations (e.g., rainfall contributes to recharge of groundwater system and drought intensifies water extraction and restricts discharge). Moreover, this study found a substantial negative correlation (r = −0.7), between SPEI at 12-month scale and GWS variation in the southern GAB region. This relationship highlights the vulnerability of groundwater storage in the southern GAB region to prolonged drought conditions. Furthermore, this study identified positive correlations (r = 0.4 to 0.8), between key climate indices such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) with GWS anomalies in the southeast and northern GAB regions. These correlations underscore the pivotal roles played by ENSO and PDO in shaping GWS variations in these areas, highlighting the need to incorporate an understanding of these climatic processes into water resource management strategies. This consideration is crucial for ensuring sustainable water management practices that can adapt to the influence of these climate phenomena. These findings provide essential insights into the dynamics of groundwater in the face of changing environmental conditions, with implications for sustainable water management.}

A crucial aspect in map rendering for its interpretation by users is the gamut of colours used for displaying data. One part of this problem is linked to the proportion of the human population that is colour blind and, therefore, highly sensitive to colour palette selection. The aim of this paper is to present the cblindplot R package and its founding function - cblind.plot() - which enables colour blind people to just enter an image in a coding workflow, simply set their colour blind deficiency type, and immediately get as output a colour blind friendly plot. We will first describe in detail colour blind problems, and then show a step by step example of the function being proposed. While examples exist to provide colour blind people with proper colour palettes, in such cases (i) the workflow include a separate import of the image and the application of a set of colour ramp palettes and (ii) albeit being well documented, there are many steps to be done before plotting an image with a colour blind friendly ramp palette. The function described in this paper, on the contrary, allows to (i) automatically call the image inside the function without any initial import step and (ii) explicitly refer to the colour blind deficiency type being experienced, to further automatically apply the proper colour ramp palette.}

Predicting where these shifts occur can help us know what to anticipate and thus design better programs and strategies for species management. Due to projected extreme climate change in many arid and semi-arid ecosystems, we hypothesized that many species adapted to these systems would experience considerable spatial shifts. To test our hypothesis, we modelled current and future habitats under different climate scenarios for three iconic carnivores (grey wolf, golden jackal, and striped hyaena) in central of Iran and calculated their spatial overlaps. Our models predict that although each species responds differently to environmental changes, their habitats are heavily influenced by climatic variables, water resources, and roads. Our models also suggest that the high-quality habitats of grey wolves and striped hyaenas will probably expand, while for golden jackals, it will decrease. Significant spatial overlap of highly suitable habitat will exist among the species, particularly between the golden jackal and the striped hyaena. The overlapped highly suitable areas for all species cover between 9% to 10% of the whole region at present and in the future. Because of the spatial overlap and decrease in rainfall in the future, the three carnivores may face competition due to climate change. Our findings are crucial for establishing conservation areas that will conserve carnivore species in the future.}

In this context, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles play an important role, as they guarantee the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of shared data. To improve the practice of data sharing, institutions, funders, and publishers are increasingly demanding data be shared as well as be of an acceptable level of quality, including compliance with FAIR principles. Therefore, the objective of this work is twofold: first, this research aims to determine the degree of compliance with the FAIR principles exhibited by a number of datasets; and second, it aims to explore useful and valid methodologies and procedures that can be used to perform this evaluation quickly, automatically, and effectively. For this purpose, the Data Citation Index (DCI) was used to obtain many datasets in the field of agriculture, which were further grouped by repositories and evaluated using the automated assessment tool F-UJI provided by the FAIRsFAIR project. The results indicated that the principle that exhibited the highest scores was “Findable”, while “Reusable” received the lowest scores, as none of the analysed repositories achieved a 50% compliance score in this respect. The datasets published in the Zenodo and Dryad repositories exhibited better overall results in terms of the FAIR principles, and the AG Commons repository was the third best rated repository, representing only one of the first three repositories belonging to the agricultural sector. Regarding the use of F-UJI as an automated assessment tool and DCI as a source for obtaining datasets, we conclude that this methodology is useful, and that although it can be improved, it is easy to use and implement by other scientific groups and agents of interest.}

abstract = {The precise mapping of coastal wetlands holds great significance for monitoring carbon sequestration and storage within coastal ecosystems, particularly in light of climate change and human-induced activities. Time series and multi-source remote sensing data offer distinct advantages in spatial and temporal land use mapping, particularly in wetland systems encompassing various vegetation types. The primary aim of this study was to delineate the spatial distribution of land use within the Liao River Delta (LRD) wetland. This was achieved by employing a stacking ensemble model that integrates time-series GaoFen-1 (GF-1) optical imagery, GaoFen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. The first step involved the application of an enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) to fuse the GF-1 NDVI and MODIS NDVI datasets, producing time-series NDVI data. Subsequently, the parameters pertaining to vegetation phenology were obtained by employing the threshold method on the time-series NDVI data. We compiled feature datasets encompassing GF-1 spectral bands, indices, phenological parameters, and GF-3 SAR features. A Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) model was employed to identify and select significant features to mitigate data redundancy. Finally, a stacking ensemble model was constructed by combining five base models [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)] to perform wetland classification. The findings were as follows: (1) ESTARFM was able to successfully fuse GF-1 NDVI and MODIS NDVI data, resulting in spatiotemporal fusion with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.07. (2) the RFECV algorithm was employed to select relevant features in the wetland classification process. Specifically, 75 spectral band features, 89 spectral index features, 13 SAR features, and seven phenological parameters were identified as significant for this task. (3) A stacking ensemble model was constructed using the aforementioned multi-source features. This model exhibited a robust and consistent performance in wetland classification, achieving the highest overall accuracy of 94.33%. Notably, this accuracy improvement ranged from approximately 0.09% to 10.02% compared to the individual base models. Thus, the present study has the potential to be utilized for fine-scale wetland monitoring, thereby offering valuable assistance in the field of wetland environmental research.}

We conducted a comprehensive study focusing on three key ungulates: wild goat (Capra aegagrus), urial (Ovis vignei), and jebeer gazelle (Gazella bennetti). These species rely heavily on migration corridors for functional connectivity, making them vulnerable to the habitat fragmentation caused by human development. Our research integrates ensemble habitat suitability modelling and connectivity analysis to assess the impacts of mining and road construction on the core habitats of these ungulates and their habitat connectivity. Ensemble models predicted large suitable habitats for all three species; however, a considerable portion of these habitats was compromised by the development of mining roads, highlighting the urgency of conservation actions. We found that wild goat habitats were patchy and fragmented, whereas urial and jebeer habitats were more expansive and better connected. Analysis of core habitats identified critical areas for the species survival. For instance, an important core area for wild goats was located in the central part of the landscape, whereas the core habitat for urials was situated in the eastern part. Multiple core areas were identified for jebeer gazelles, highlighting the diverse habitat preferences of the species. We found extensive overlap between the core habitats of the three species and conservation areas (approximately 80%). Connectivity simulations revealed strong conservation network coverage (between 81 and 91%), emphasizing the importance of conservation areas. Our findings underscore the immediate need for conservation interventions to mitigate the impacts of road development on ungulate habitats and migration corridors in central Iran. This research contributes vital information for informed decision-making in conservation planning and sustainable development in the region.}

The difficulty lies in accurately identifying and quantifying bias and the scarcity of samples, which greatly impedes the implementation of bias correction. Current methods often adjust the distribution of presence or background points within geographic or environmental spaces to correct the sampling bias in probability estimation within SDMs. However, these methods may lead to information loss, rely on subjective assumptions, and often separate geography and environment when correcting for bias. This study proposes a novel and easily implementable method termed “aggregation background.” This method selects background data based on the aggregation degree of presence points in the geographic and environmental feature space, thereby approximating the representation and correction of sampling bias in the presence samples. We compared this new method with other prevalent sampling bias correction methods in the existing literature by analyzing ecological authenticity. Under varying biases and sample sizes, the aggregation background and geographic filtering methods achieved more accurate species distribution predictions compared to the target group background and other methods. Notably, when the sample size was small (≤70), the aggregation background was superior to that obtained using the geographic filtering method. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the aggregation background in improving bias correction using limited available presence sample data, without relying on assumptions about sampling bias. Our method provides a new approach for correcting complex unknown biases in SDMs.}

abstract = {Many mangrove forests located along estuaries and deltas worldwide are currently facing irreparable losses caused by natural factors and intensive anthropogenic disturbances. The limited capabilities of traditional remote sensing processing platforms tend to lead to poor image processing consistency in medium- and large-scale areas, resulting in lower ground object classification accuracy. Consequently, little information is available regarding the extent and causes of variation in large-scale mangrove forests. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine mangrove forest data from eight periods between 1985 and 2020, with total accuracy rates of 82.95–90.15%, and combined landscape metrics with a centroid transfer model to quantitatively analyze the landscape evolution of mangrove forests in China. Finally, we employed a geodetector based on optimized parameters to quantitatively determine the potential mechanisms driving mangrove landscape evolution. Overall, a slight increase followed by a sharp decrease in mangrove forest area in China during the past 40 years, with a turning point around 2000 and substantial shifts in mangrove spatial patterns in Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, particularly in the Pearl River Estuary and Beibu Gulf. The landscape pattern of Chinese mangrove forests has become fragmented and isolated through rapid urbanization in recent decades. Mangrove forests shifted significantly (> 31 km) early in the study period, followed by smaller shifts later in the study period. The optimal spatial scale of mangrove landscape driver detection was 270 m × 270 m. The variation in mangrove forest area was caused by the interactions of multiple factors, particularly between mean annual precipitation and other potential influencing factors. Government policies guided the conservation and management of mangrove forests in China to varying degrees throughout the study period. Our findings on the dynamics of mangrove forests provide a reference for integrated coastal management, which will contribute to the ecological utilization and high-quality development of coasts during extensive urbanization along the southeastern coast of China and similar large estuary deltas worldwide.}

This study develops a novel risk zoning and multifactor analysis framework for ecological carbon sink management in Yunnan Province, China, a region recognized for its ecological diversity and carbon sequestration potential. Our results reveal that high-priority ecological carbon sink zones, mainly in the southwest and western regions, cover 20% of the total area and contain over 60% of the province's carbon stocks. In contrast, high-risk zones, primarily in urbanized regions, show a reduction in carbon sequestration, with emissions exceeding 25.7 million kg due to urban development and landscape degradation. The analysis delineated five distinct risk zones; urgent intervention zones, risk control zones, priority restoration zones, long-term conservation zones, and integrated management zones. Notably, urgent intervention and priority restoration zones, while representing just 9.6% of the area, are critical for protecting over 40% of the carbon sequestration potential. The comprehensive risk zoning framework, combining principal component and canonical correspondence analysis (PCA-CCA), effectively integrates landscape indicators, socio-economic factors, and natural elements. Our innovative, data-driven approach offers strategic insights into managing carbon sinks while balancing ecological integrity and socioeconomic needs, providing a replicable model for ecosystem management.}

Previous research has focused mainly on identifying the main drivers of vegetation growth, while the direct and indirect effects of climate, terrain, and human activity on vegetation growth have rarely been explored. This study used the Minjiang River Basin (MRB), an important ecological barrier and the largest watershed in southeastern China, as an example. The kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) was calculated on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to examine the spatial pattern and evolution characteristics of vegetation growth. The optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD) and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) were used to analyze how terrain, climate, and human activity influenced the spatial pattern of the kNDVI. (1) From 2001 to 2020, vegetation growth in the MRB was predominantly rated as excellent or good, and 88.93% of the area showed an increasing trend of vegetation growth. (2) The OPGD revealed that the primary drivers influencing the spatial distribution of the kNDVI in the MRB included population density, nighttime light, elevation and temperature, which explained >40% of the variation in the kNDVI. The interaction of all paired drivers enhanced the explanatory power of the kNDVI, among which the strongest interaction was between population density and elevation, and the second interaction was between population density and temperature. (3) PLS-SEM revealed that human activity had a direct negative effect on the kNDVI, while terrain and climate had direct and indirect positive effects on the kNDVI. Overall, the total effects of terrain, climate and human activity on the kNDVI were 0.594, 0.233 and − 0.495, respectively, indicating that the positive effect of terrain outweighed the negative effect of human activity on vegetation growth in the MRB. These findings not only provide scientific evidence for ecological conservation and management in the MRB but also offer a useful reference for other regions exploring the complex causes of spatial patterns of vegetation growth.}

One potential big issue, however, is the fact that the substantial release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from biomass combustion significantly impacts the global climate system and carbon balance. This study aims to assess the emissions of major carbon-containing gases from forest fires in mainland China between 2011 and 2021. Information on wildfires was obtained with Google Earth Engine (GEE) through the integration of MODIS products and Global Forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) produced by the Climate Change Initiative Biomass (CCI BIOMASS) Programme. Utilizing the combustible load model and consideration of carbon emission factors in different vegetation, from 2011 to 2022, mainland China consumed an estimated 35.55 Tg C (3.23 Tg C yr−1) of above-ground combustible matter, resulting in 46.94 Tg (4.27 Tg yr−1) of carbon-containing gas emissions. Among these emissions, 42.16 Tg (3.83 Tg yr−1), 4.58 Tg (0.42 Tg yr−1), and 0.20 Tg (0.02 Tg yr−1) were attributed to CO2, CO, and CH4. In general, carbon emissions from forest fires in mainland China exhibited a declining pattern with fluctuations. This indicates a substantial decrease in average annual emissions of CO2 and CH4 by 48.38% and 88.87%, respectively, compared to the previous century (1990s). Additionally, there was an average annual decrease in biomass consumption of approximately 35.4%. When analyzing the results on regional scales using linear regression and normalization methods, it was found that 81%–84% of provinces and regions in mainland China showed a decline in forest fire carbon emissions. Nevertheless, several areas in the northwest region displayed a noticeable rising trend. Pixel analysis is utilized in this paper to perform a spatial analysis of carbon emissions and fire locations associated with forestry fires in mainland China. This analysis clarifies the impact of combustible load distribution across different fire intensities on the interannual variability of carbon emissions from wildfires, thereby offering fire management authorities valuable insights.}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to support the application of Integrated Pest Management strategies against H. halys. The proposal is based on the experience of a three-year project in which a network of monitoring traps has been deployed throughout the whole Emilia-Romagna region and a data platform has been implemented to enable the real-time tracking of H. halys occurrence and distribution, integrating these information with multiple data sources, and analytical capabilities through a public website. Besides the real-time pest surveillance, the data platform allowed us to increase our understanding about H. halys seasonal invasion dynamics and the main factors contributing to its spread. The results will help individual growers in protecting their crops and the whole region in promoting more efficient usage of insecticides and more sustainable and healthy agricultural productions.}

Employing the Residual Trend method and integrating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with land use/cover, this study assesses the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation dynamics across China from 2000 to 2018. The findings indicate a consistent upward trend of China's Growing Season NDVI (GSN), averaging a change rate of 0.0032/yr. Human activities are the primary drivers of this change, contributing 82.47% to GSN in China, while climate change accounts for 17.53%. The effect of human activities on vegetation dynamics showed considerable variation across different river basins, with the Huaihe River Basin experiencing the highest human impact (93.53%) and the Continental Basin the lowest (76.27%). Conversely, the Continental Basin experienced the greatest impact from climate change (23.73%), compared to the minimal influence in the Huaihe River Basin (6.47%). The study results offer contribution rates for each type of changed and unchanged land use, with persistent forestland, persistent grassland, persistent cropland, and grassland to forest conversion contributing 28.65%, 22.09%, 13.76%, and 4.61%, respectively.

Within the persistent forestlands of the Yangtze, Pearl, and Southeast River Basins, human activities accounted for 26.99%, 42.18%, and 43.50% of the vegetation alterations, respectively. These findings provide a scientific basis for formulating effective ecosystem management and protection strategies.}

Previous attempts to develop tree trunk detection methods have faced limitations in respect of precision and generalization due to the use of hand-engineered features and the constraint of single-species detection. In this study, we construct a new tree trunk dataset considering the object’s strong diversity and propose a deep model to detect and segment the salient tree trunks or even branches in urban scenes. Comprehensive experiments are performed to evaluate our model. The presented method exhibits exceptional performance, evidenced by its outstanding scores across seven evaluation metrics, indicating its capability to segment tree trunks of different species, even if they exhibit significant variations in appearance. Specifically, our model demonstrates outstanding accuracy in detecting trunks with intricate furcations, as well as effectively identifying trunks that are partially occluded.}

abstract = {Monitoring spatiotemporal patterns in marine environments is crucial to ensure a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and, ultimately, for adequate management and marine conservation policies. The lack of resources required for surveys and data acquisition often hampers the availability of long-term datasets, which can be partly mitigated by leveraging citizen science and information technologies to crowdsource data. There is an inherent trade-off between the quality of data obtained using scientific and systematic protocols, and that collected by citizen scientists in an opportunistic fashion. In this pilot study, we explore crowdsourcing data from recreational SCUBA divers using a mobile app to report sightings of a predetermined list of taxa, which have been selected by regional experts as biological indicators. This approach uses post-dive queries that provide some level of standardisation, by focusing on the frequency and abundance of specific taxa, while retaining a recreational dive plan. Additionally, the app also collects metadata on location, number of dives and number of divers enabling normalisation based on “sampling effort”. In this pilot study, the use of the app was tested to compile information on the frequency and abundance of 18 marine taxa selected by local experts based on their conservation status, commercial interest, ecological function and/or their non-indigenous origin. Additionally, a question-based survey was conducted to assess the opinion of users on the app's usability and the potential value for the diving community/industry, showcasing a high usability score and interest among users. Basic statistical analysis of the data crowdsourced over the 1-month trial illustrates the potential and value of regional monitoring programs using custom lists of taxa and an app to crowdsource data from local dive centres and divers. With the ability to customise the list of taxa used in a region, monitoring programs that leverage mobile apps during post-dive interviews can provide valuable information on species occurrences in any region with active recreational dive operations. Such programs are cost-effective scalable solutions that can easily provide complementary data that can be used to monitor the proliferation of non-indigenous species, to assess the efficacy of conservation measures on protected and endangered species and to assess economically exploited species, as they can track time fluctuations and spatial variations in any conspicuous taxa that scuba divers can report.}

abstract = {The urban acoustic environment (AE) provides comprehensive acoustic information related to the diverse systems of urban areas, such as traffic, the built environment, or biodiversity. The decreasing cost of acoustic sensors and rapid growth of storage space and computational power have fostered the collection of large amounts of acoustical data to be processed. However, despite the extensive information that is recorded by modern acoustic sensors, few approaches are established to capture the rich complex dynamics embedded in the time-frequency domain of the urban AE. Quantitative methods need to account for this complexity, while effectively reducing the high dimensionality of acoustic features within the data. Therefore, we introduce complex networks as a tool for analyzing the complex structure of large-scale urban AE data. We present a framework to construct networks based on frequency correlation matrices (FCMs). FCMs have shown to be a promising tool to depict environment specific interrelationships between consecutive power spectra. Accordingly, we show the capabilities of complex networks for the quantification of these interrelationships and thus, to characterize different urban AEs. We demonstrate the scope of the proposed method, using one of the world's most extensive longitudinal audio datasets, considering 3-min audio recordings (n = 319,385 ≙ 665 days) from 23 sites. We construct networks from hour-of-day specific audio recordings for each site. We show that the average shortest path length (ASPL) as an indicator for dominance of sound sources in the urban AE exhibits spatial- and temporal-specific patterns between the sites, which allows us to identify four to seven clusters of distinct urban AEs. To validate our findings, we use the land use mix around each site as a proxy for the AE and compare those between and within the clusters. The identified clusters show high intra- and low inter-cluster correlations of ASPL diel cycles as well as strong intra-similarities in land use mix. Our results indicate that complex networks are a promising approach to analyze large-scale audio data, expanding our understanding of the time-frequency domain of the urban AE.}

abstract = {We classified land cover types from 1940s historical aerial imagery using Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and compared these maps with data on recent cover. Few studies have used these kinds of maps to model drivers of cover change, partly due to two statistical challenges: 1) appropriately accounting for spatial autocorrelation and 2) appropriately modeling percent cover which is bounded between 0 and 100 and not normally distributed. We studied the change in woody cover at four sites in California's North Coast using historical (1948) and recent (2009) high spatial resolution imagery. We classified the imagery using eCognition Developer and aggregated the resulting maps to the scale of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in order to understand topographic drivers of woody cover change. We used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with a quasi-binomial probability distribution to account for spatial autocorrelation and the boundedness of the percent woody cover variable. We explored the relative influences on current percent woody cover of topographic variables (grouped using principal component analysis) reflecting water retention capacity, exposure, and within-site context, as well as historical percent woody cover and geographical coordinates. We estimated these models for pixel sizes of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100m, reflecting both tree neighborhood scales and stand scales. We found that historical woody cover had a consistent positive effect on current woody cover, and that the spatial autoregressive term in the model was significant even after controlling for historical cover. Specific topographic variables emerged as important for different sites at different scales, but no overall pattern emerged across sites or scales for any of the topographic variables we tested. This GAM framework for modeling historical data is flexible and could be used with more variables, more flexible relationships with predictor variables, and larger scales. Modeling drivers of woody cover change from historical ecology data sources can be a valuable way to plan restoration and enhance ecological insight into landscape change.}

abstract = {Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016–2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. “S-Upstream”, “S-Downstream” and “S-Total”. Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3% for S-Up; 8.6% for S-Down and 13% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (€15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at €29,580,643 and €65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.}
