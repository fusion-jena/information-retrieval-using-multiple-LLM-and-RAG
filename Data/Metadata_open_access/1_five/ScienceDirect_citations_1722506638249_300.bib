abstract = {Nowadays crop mapping as an interdisciplinary hot topic attracted both agriculture and remote sensing researchers' interests. This study proposed an automatic method to map citrus orchards in Juybar, Iran, where planting citrus trees is booming there. In this regard, 148 Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS Digital Surface Model (DSM) tiles are processed in Google Earth Engine to provide a hybrid feature set including initial satellite images, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textural features, and spectral features such as vegetation, built-up, bare-soil indices, and the proposed Vegetation Dynamic Index (VDI). A semi-automatic sample selection paradigm is also developed based on a time-series analysis of 12 monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs), Otsu thresholding, multi-level thresholding (MLT), and using two proposed indices called Evergreenness Index (EGI) and Water-covered or No-vegetation (WCNV) index, and finally human post-revision. The output of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using 60,000 samples and the post-classification operation showed that the classified map has an average overall accuracy (OA) and an average kappa coefficient (KC) equal to 99.7% and 0.992, respectively. The results show that multispectral bands lonely extracted orchards with high accuracy (OA: 99.55%, KC: 0.986), and the rest of the features only made a slight improvement to that. For the year 2019, an area of about 4351 ha is estimated as citrus orchards, which is in accordance with the agriculture department's reports (~4700 ha). The results indicate that from 2016 to 2019, despite a “citrus to non-citrus” land-use conversion of about 754 ha, the citrus orchards area was totally expanded by about 17%. Comparing the results with the Google Earth images indicates the precise extraction of orchards with a 10 m spatial resolution. To use the proposed method for extensive cases or areas with other types of evergreen trees, it is recommended to use high-resolution normalized DSMs (nDSMs) and textural features.}

abstract = {Rising global temperatures are a threat to the current state of the Arctic. In particular, permafrost degradation has been impacting the terrestrial cryosphere in many ways, including effects on carbon cycling and the global climate, regional hydrological connectivity and ecosystem dynamics, as well as human health and infrastructure. However, the ability to simulate permafrost dynamics under future climate projections is limited, and model outputs are often associated with large uncertainties. A model structured on a Bayesian Network is presented to address existing limitations in the representation of physically complex processes and the limited availability of observational data. A strength of Bayesian methods over more traditional modeling methods is the ability to integrate various types of evidence (i.e., observations, model outputs, expert assessments) into a single model by mapping the evidence into probability distributions. Here, we outline PermaBN, a new modeling framework, to simulate permafrost thaw in the continuous permafrost region of the Arctic. Pre-validation and expert assessment validation results show that the model produces estimations of permafrost thaw depth that are consistent with current research, i.e., thaw depth increases during the snow-free season under initial conditions favoring warming temperatures, lowered soil moisture conditions, and low active layer ice content. Using a case study from northwestern Canada to evaluate PermaBN, we show that model performance is enhanced when certainty about the system components increases for known scenarios described by observations directly integrated into the model; in this case, insulation properties from vegetation were integrated to the model. Overall, PermaBN could provide informative predictions about permafrost dynamics without high computational cost and with the ability to integrate multiple types of evidence that traditional physics-based models sometimes do not account for, allowing PermaBN to be applied to carbon modeling studies, infrastructure hazard assessments, and policy decisions aimed at mitigation of, and adaptation to, permafrost degradation.}
