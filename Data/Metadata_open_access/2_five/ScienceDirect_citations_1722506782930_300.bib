abstract = {Groundwater aquifers around the world are experiencing stress due to the composite influence of climate change and excessive groundwater withdrawal. Despite this influence, there is still insufficient knowledge on climate-groundwater interaction dynamics in complex aquifers like Australia's Great Artesian Basin. This understanding can inform improved management, which can in turn, increase resilience of groundwater system to on-going groundwater withdrawal and climate change. The main aim of this research was to assess the impacts of climatic change on groundwater storage (GWS) changes over the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) using a range of multi-scale indicators, including Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived groundwater observations and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices (SPEI). Rotated principal component analysis (rPCA) was used to identify climatic hotspots (where GWS variation is particularly sensitive or vulnerable to the impacts of climate change), and correlation analyses were used to assess the relationship between these hotspots and changes in groundwater over space and time. The localized spatial pattern via rPCA was uncovered in the GAB's southeastern region, where annual variations in GWS exhibited conspicuous peaks in 2002, 2014, and 2015. Another finding was that the southeast region of the GAB experienced higher GWS variations as compared to other sub-basins during 2007–2008, which resulted in low groundwater recharge. These findings underscore the variations in GWS within the GAB, emphasizing its responsiveness to climatic variations (e.g., rainfall contributes to recharge of groundwater system and drought intensifies water extraction and restricts discharge). Moreover, this study found a substantial negative correlation (r = −0.7), between SPEI at 12-month scale and GWS variation in the southern GAB region. This relationship highlights the vulnerability of groundwater storage in the southern GAB region to prolonged drought conditions. Furthermore, this study identified positive correlations (r = 0.4 to 0.8), between key climate indices such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) with GWS anomalies in the southeast and northern GAB regions. These correlations underscore the pivotal roles played by ENSO and PDO in shaping GWS variations in these areas, highlighting the need to incorporate an understanding of these climatic processes into water resource management strategies. This consideration is crucial for ensuring sustainable water management practices that can adapt to the influence of these climate phenomena. These findings provide essential insights into the dynamics of groundwater in the face of changing environmental conditions, with implications for sustainable water management.}

abstract = {Nowadays crop mapping as an interdisciplinary hot topic attracted both agriculture and remote sensing researchers' interests. This study proposed an automatic method to map citrus orchards in Juybar, Iran, where planting citrus trees is booming there. In this regard, 148 Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS Digital Surface Model (DSM) tiles are processed in Google Earth Engine to provide a hybrid feature set including initial satellite images, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textural features, and spectral features such as vegetation, built-up, bare-soil indices, and the proposed Vegetation Dynamic Index (VDI). A semi-automatic sample selection paradigm is also developed based on a time-series analysis of 12 monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs), Otsu thresholding, multi-level thresholding (MLT), and using two proposed indices called Evergreenness Index (EGI) and Water-covered or No-vegetation (WCNV) index, and finally human post-revision. The output of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using 60,000 samples and the post-classification operation showed that the classified map has an average overall accuracy (OA) and an average kappa coefficient (KC) equal to 99.7% and 0.992, respectively. The results show that multispectral bands lonely extracted orchards with high accuracy (OA: 99.55%, KC: 0.986), and the rest of the features only made a slight improvement to that. For the year 2019, an area of about 4351 ha is estimated as citrus orchards, which is in accordance with the agriculture department's reports (~4700 ha). The results indicate that from 2016 to 2019, despite a “citrus to non-citrus” land-use conversion of about 754 ha, the citrus orchards area was totally expanded by about 17%. Comparing the results with the Google Earth images indicates the precise extraction of orchards with a 10 m spatial resolution. To use the proposed method for extensive cases or areas with other types of evergreen trees, it is recommended to use high-resolution normalized DSMs (nDSMs) and textural features.}

The descriptive and predictive power of correlative SDMs is highly valued to meet the high demand for filling gaps in the spatial ecology of wide-ranging and elusive species, such as cetaceans and sea turtles, living in habitats that are technically challenging to survey and where the availability of high quality, unbiased data at appropriate spatial and temporal resolution is not straightforward. This study endeavours to offer a comprehensive global overview of recent advancements in modelling techniques within the realm of SDMs applied to cetaceans and sea turtles. Through a rigorous systematic review of 295 research papers, we identified gaps in species and geographic coverage and highlighted the underrepresentation of biotic, anthropogenic, and water column variables. Our examination revealed a diverse array of modelling approaches, showcasing a notable preference for standard regression-based or machine-learning models, such as GAMs or Maxent, with Bayesian-based models emerging and experiencing growing development. Critical limitations and decisions in constructing and evaluating SDMs were discussed, proposing best practices for future studies. Emphasis was placed on the importance of validating models using fully independent datasets, particularly in the context of conservationist studies. This work not only sheds light on the state of the field but also serves as a valuable tool for those interested in modelling the distribution of these magnificent and enigmatic animals, as well as other cryptic species, offering insights that can guide researchers in making informed decisions in the realm of SDMs.}

We assessed the arable land ecological footprint (CEF) in the Yellow and Huaihai main grain-producing areas from 2010 to 2020, employing ecological and productive footprint analyses. Additionally, we built a structural equation model for per capita CEF in the Yellow and Huaihai main grain-producing area, incorporating China's ecological economic theory and the economic-social-ecological structural system to identify influencing factors. Our findings indicate the following: (1) CEF in area showed a fluctuating upward trend during 2010–2020, while the ecological carrying capacity of arable land decreased, resulting in ecological surplus, except in 2017; (2) arable land's sustainable pressure index increased, signifying low ecological safety in the Yellow and Huaihai main grain producing area, and the sustainable efficiency index decreased, indicating resource efficiency improvements; and (3) the structural equation model reveals that arable land output, ecological conditions, socioeconomics, and resource inputs all impact per capita ecological footprints in the respective order.

abstract = {Air pollution is a pressing concern, especially in developing countries, and its impact on the climate, physical health, and overall quality of life cannot be overstated. This study focuses on the Tehran province, Iran, aiming to clarify the role of different industrial activities in emitting air pollution. To achieve this objective, zonal areas spanning 3.2 km were designated for each industrial establishment within the province and subsequently categorized based on their respective activities forming industrial clusters. Five Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor vertical column density (VCD) data products, along with several other auxiliary datasets, were utilized to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of major air pollutants, including formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and tropospheric ozone (O3), and to forecast their concentration trends within each cluster. The use of the Exponential Smoothing Model (ESM) for forecasting was necessitated by the limited temporal coverage of available datasets from Sentinel-5P. This model, utilizing weighted averages of past observations to predict future values, was deemed suitable for addressing the temporal constraints of the datasets. The spatial analysis revealed three dispersion patterns in the study area: HCHO, CO, and NO2 exhibited island-like patterns, SO2 exhibited spot-like patterns, and tropospheric O3 exhibited topography-influenced patterns. The temporal analysis revealed significant inter-annual patterns and variations in pollutant concentrations among industrial clusters. Average concentrations of CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 reached their peaks during the cooler months of the year, likely attributable to temperature inversions and heightened usage of heating components, leading to increased combustion of fossil fuels. In contrast, peak levels of HCHO were observed during warmer months, a trend that may be attributed to intensified photochemical processes resulting from the heightened intensity of solar radiation. According to the ESM results, the concentration of HCHO above lime/plaster factories, the concentration of CO above petroleum refineries, power plants, and asphalt/sand factories, and the concentration of SO2 and NO2 above all studied clusters are forecasted to increase until 2025. In contrast, the tropospheric O3 concentration is expected to decrease during the same period. The methodology utilized in this study can be applied to other regions to identify major sources of air pollution and predict future trends.}

Previous efforts in implementing H. halys surveillance at the regional level were mainly focused on studying the H. halys phenology, but they were not designed to provide a public service. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to support the application of Integrated Pest Management strategies against H. halys. The proposal is based on the experience of a three-year project in which a network of monitoring traps has been deployed throughout the whole Emilia-Romagna region and a data platform has been implemented to enable the real-time tracking of H. halys occurrence and distribution, integrating these information with multiple data sources, and analytical capabilities through a public website. Besides the real-time pest surveillance, the data platform allowed us to increase our understanding about H. halys seasonal invasion dynamics and the main factors contributing to its spread. The results will help individual growers in protecting their crops and the whole region in promoting more efficient usage of insecticides and more sustainable and healthy agricultural productions.}

abstract = {The Amazon rainforest has faced extensive deforestation for decades due to urban growth, agricultural expansion, logging and mining. Mining however has been relatively understudied in the Amazon. The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop an effective cloud-based classification approach coupled with an innovative semi-automated reclassification method; (2) to quantify the mining extent and its impacts on forest cover in Suriname from 1997 to 2019; and (3) to evaluate the impact of mining on the structure and health of the forest. Landsat 5 and 8 images were used for the initial land-use/land-cover classification using the classification and regression trees algorithm in Google Earth Engine. The resulting classified maps were reclassified in a semi-automated model to correct misclassifications between mining and urban pixels. The final maps were used to analyse the expansion of mining and its impacts on forest cover, structure (using the fragmentation metric effective mesh size), and forest health (using the phenology metric peak greenness). The combined approach resulted in an improvement in mining detection accuracy from 72% (65% producer, 79% user) to 89.5% (84% producer accuracy, 95% user). The results showed that mining increased from 69.4 km2 in 1997 to 431.6 km2 in 2019, an increase by 522% over 22 years, which led to 421.3 km2 of forest loss, of which 85% was due to artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM). The loss of forest for ASGM resulted in greater fragmentation, with a decrease in effective mesh size by 122.8 km2 compared to a decrease by 83 km2 caused by industrial mining. Mining also caused a decrease in the health of the surrounding forest, with a larger decrease in peak greenness due to ASGM compared to industrial mining. The results demonstrate the potential of this approach that leverages cloud-based machine learning with a semi-automated reclassification to allow for rapid, accurate, and potentially global mining detection.}

abstract = {Accurate canopy cover estimation is essential for mature and early-stage young forests, as it guides forest management and silvicultural activities necessary for their growth and regeneration. However, obtaining precise measurements of canopy cover in the field is time-consuming and challenging, especially at the regional and landscape levels. Remote sensing techniques offer a promising alternative to traditional field-based measurements for estimating forest canopy cover. In this study, our objective is to estimate forest canopy cover using vegetation indices derived from the multispectral bands of PlanetScope (Planet Lab, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilise PlanetScope imagery data for estimating canopy cover in young boreal forests. Based on the analysis of four bands (green, blue, red, and near-infrared) from PlanetScope imagery, 43 vegetation indices, including four spectral bands and 13 salinity indices, were computed to select predictors in canopy cover modelling. Six regression models were employed to model canopy cover: linear, elastic net, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine. All the models demonstrated good performance for both the training dataset (R2 = 0.58–0.69) and the testing dataset (R2 = 0.59–0.64, RMSE = 0.16–0.18, rRMSE = 22%–23%, and MAE = 0.12–0.14). Based on the fit statistics in the training and testing datasets and the paired t-test, our study identified the light gradient boosting machine as the most suitable model for predicting canopy cover in young boreal forests. For the light gradient boosting machine, the R2 value was 0.69 (training), and for testing data, the R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.16, rRMSE = 22%, and MAE = 0.12. Therefore, we recommend that future researchers utilise Planet multispectral data and the light gradient boosting machine regression to estimate forest canopy cover at a higher spatial resolution. However, exploring additional machine learning algorithms and explicitly boosting methods when computing forest canopy cover using satellite remote sensing is strongly advised.}

To limit the socio-economic impact, it is essential to develop simple and fast numerical models that can predict these different cycles. Here, we aimed to improve the predictive performance and extracting relevant information from climatic events by applying the signature method to time series models. After transforming the data using this signature method, we performed a comparative analysis of the statistical and machine learning models. In addition, we used PDP (Partial Dependence Plot) and SPRC (Standard Partial Regression Coefficient) to better understand the interactions between different climate indices. Our results showed that the best predictive performance was obtained when we use the signature method with the LSTM (R2 = 0.74) and Lasso (R2 = 0.79) models. Two complementary methods were used to highlight the influence of the following climate indices on ENSO cycle changes: NINO3, NINO3.4 and NPI (North Pacific Index). These methodologies also enabled us to determine the switchover thresholds, and order temporal variations. With this first application of the signature method to this type of time series, we obtained accurate forecasts on a 6-month scale with reduced computation time. This suggests that our methodology can be applied to many other fields of research that use multivariate time-series analyses.}

Population dynamics models are important tools in ecology and conservation. Modern Bayesian approaches allow biologically realistic models to be constructed and fitted to multiple data sources in an integrated modelling framework based on a class of statistical models called state space models. However, model fitting is often slow, requiring hours to weeks of computation. We demonstrate the benefits of GPU computing using a model for the population dynamics of British grey seals, fitted with a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Speed-ups of two orders of magnitude were obtained for estimations of the log-likelihood, compared to a traditional ‘CPU-only’ implementation, allowing for an accurate method of inference to be used where this was previously too computationally expensive to be viable. GPU computing has enormous potential, but one barrier to further adoption is a steep learning curve, due to GPUs' unique hardware architecture. We provide a detailed description of hardware and software setup, and our case study provides a template for other similar applications. We also provide a detailed tutorial-style description of GPU hardware architectures, and examples of important GPU-specific programming practices.}

A variety of methods have been used to estimate population density, with two of the most common being distance sampling (DS) and spatial capture recapture (SCR). We evaluated precision and bias of density estimators through a simulation study of DS using data collected from either human observer point counts or automated recording units (ARUs), and SCR using trapping data or trapping data augmented with telemetry data. We then fit each of the four models to empirical data collected during autumn 2016–2018 for a population of northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus on Di-Lane Wildlife Management Area in Georgia. Density estimates in our simulation study were relatively unbiased using all four methods but were most accurate for the two SCR methods. Empirical density estimates were similar across methods and years, with annual averages of 0.41 birds per ha in 2016, 0.44 birds per ha in 2017 and 0.31 birds per ha in 2018. In general, both SCR methods were also the most precise using the empirical data, although ARU distance sampling did also produce comparable density estimates and precision values. Although SCR methods performed the best overall, cost and increased labor of these monitoring programs should be evaluated in relation to the relative ease of ARU deployment or point count surveys, which also provided adequate, and often similar, density estimates. Integrating these constraints into a structured decision-making framework will aid managers weighing decisions regarding how to monitor, and ultimately make management decisions.}

abstract = {The industrialization has been the primary cause of the economic boom in almost all countries. However, this happened at the cost of the environment, as industrialization also caused carbon emissions to increase exponentially. According to the established literature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is related to carbon emissions (CO2) which could be optimally employed to precisely estimate a country's GDP. However, the scarcity of data is a significant bottleneck that could be handled using transfer learning (TL) which uses previously learned information to resolve new tasks, more specifically, related tasks. Notably, TL is highly vulnerable to performance degradation due to the deficiency of suitable information and hesitancy in decision-making. Therefore, this paper proposes ‘Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL)’, which is trained to use CO2 emission data of developed nations and is tested for its prediction of GDP in a developing nation. IFTL exploits the concepts of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and a newly introduced function called the modified Hausdorff distance function. The proposed IFTL is investigated to demonstrate its actual capabilities for TL in modeling hesitancy. To further emphasize the role of hesitancy modelled with IFSs, we propose an ordinary fuzzy set (FS) based transfer learning. The prediction accuracy of the IFTL is further compared with widely used machine learning approaches, extreme learning machines, support vector regression, and generalized regression neural networks. It is observed that IFTL capably ensured significant improvements in the prediction accuracy over other existing approaches whenever training and testing data have huge data distribution differences. Moreover, the proposed IFTL is deterministic in nature and presents a novel way for mathematically computing the intuitionistic hesitation degree.}
